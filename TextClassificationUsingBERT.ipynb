She is young -- 27 years old -- and successful.</br></br>Ms. Scott is also part of a fast-growing group in corporate America: black professional women. Between 1982 and 1992, this group grew a heady 125%. Black female professionals in the 38,000 companies that report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission now number almost 200,000.</br></br>This is, of course, minuscule compared with the number of white professionals -- male and female. But it is nearly twice the number of black male professionals. According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal of EEOC data, there were 1.2 black female professionals for every black male professional in 1982. Now, there are 1.8. Though white women have made substantial gains relative to white men, white men continue to have a greater share of professional jobs: In 1982 there were 0.62 white women professionals for every white man; in 1992, there were 0.94.</br></br>Black women also are making strides in the more general category of \"white collar, excluding clerical.\" In 1982, there were slightly more black women than black men in that category. By 1992, the number of black women in those jobs had grown 90% to about 815,000, while the number of men had grown less than 50%, to about 564,000.</br></br>That black women are rising more rapidly than black men in corporate America is a source of mixed feelings for blacks. Considering the obstacles to promotion that minorities of all kinds often face, the success of black women professionals is reason for pride.\n",

            "TEXT --->  The United States in recent months has been preoccupied with the Middle East and with the near-term crisis posed by North Korea's announcement that it has nuclear weapons. But there are other long- term developments taking place that will change the political landscape of Asia in ways that will ultimately weaken U.S. influence there. Policy makers in Washington seem scarcely to have noticed, much less arrived at a long-term strategy for dealing with these developments.</br></br>Since 1945, East Asia has never had the internal cohesion or organization of Europe, with the latter's strong multilateral institutions like the European Union and NATO. But this is beginning to change. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) joined with the three major Northeast Asian powers, China, Japan and South Korea, to form a group called Asean Plus Three in 1998. In addition, the Chiang Mai Initiative links the central banks of 13 East Asian countries and provides swap facilities in case of speculative attacks of the sort that occurred during the financial crisis of 1997-98. At the Asean summit meeting in Vientiane, Laos, last December, the organization decided to hold an East Asian Summit some time next year in Kuala Lumpur that would bring together the leaders of the Asean Plus Three group, but not those of the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, or India.</br></br>There is a great deal of irony in this development. In 1990, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohammed proposed the creation of an East Asian Economic Caucus, a multilateral grouping of East Asian powers that would deliberately exclude countries like the U.S. and Australia -- a \"caucus without the Caucasians.\" The U.S. and Australia were vehemently opposed to this. At American behest, the Japanese quietly sought to kill the idea, while the Australians worked hard to promote a more inclusive Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as an alternative. What Asean Plus Three and the proposed East Asian Summit represent is a resurrection of the old Mahathir proposal, but this time with mighty China rather than tiny Malaysia driving the process forward. Japan, which earlier had acted as America's cat's paw in stopping the Mahathir plan, is now on board.</br></br>The roots of these developments lie in the Asian economic crisis, and in a series of highly effective Chinese diplomatic initiatives over the past several years. There has always been a huge gulf in perceptions about the causes and consequences of the Asian crisis between the U.S. and countries in East Asia. Americans tended to see the problem as one of crony capitalism, poor corporate governance, and flawed exchange rate management on the part of Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and other countries. The East Asians, by contrast, interpreted the behavior of the U.S. and U.S.-influenced international financial institutions like the IMF as narrowly self-interested, seeking to open up Asian financial markets to U.S. investment banks. To this day, South Koreans refer to the crisis of late 1997 as the \"IMF crisis.\"</br></br>In the aftermath of the crisis, Washington continued to bat down proposals from the region for new institutions to mitigate future financial shocks, like the Japanese proposal for an Asian IMF. Since the Clinton administration had little to offer the region in terms of new ideas or institutions, countries there took matters into their own hands and established the Chiang Mai Initiative and Asean Plus Three. Things have gotten no better under the Bush administration, which has made the war on terrorism the lens through which it saw regional cooperation.\n",

            "TEXT --->  New York -- The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 were followed by understandable predictions of a plunge in consumer spending. Those forecasts were based partly on various readings of consumer sentiment, which dropped sharply. Goodbye to one of the few pillars holding up a wobbly economy, observers prematurely concluded.</br></br>Truth turned out to be stranger than fiction. October 2001 will go down in economic history as the month Americans purchased the greatest number of autos -- ever. While that was largely attributed to auto makers' 0% financing offers, it still leaves unanswered why supposedly depressed Americans were plenty willing to visit -- of all places -- car dealerships. Harder to explain still is why the level of retail spending, after falling in September, has been higher in every succeeding month than it was in August. Indeed, even excluding autos, retail sales grew in every month during the past half-year compared with a year ago. All this while the most closely watched of the two main confidence gauges still hasn't topped pre-Sept. 11 heights.</br></br>Could it be that consumer sentiment isn't so closely tied to spending behavior after all? And if so, what does that mean for the U.S. economy now? Carl Steidtmann, chief economist of Deloitte Research, jointly owned by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touch and Deloitte Consulting, believes he has an answer.</br></br>Mr. Steidtmann compared changes in consumer confidence and consumer spending over the past 20 years. His finding: There is very little, if any, relationship between confidence and spending. There are a number of possible explanations for the disconnect, but the most important is that \"spending and confidence are driven by a different set of factors,\" he says. Specifically, politics, disasters and war drive confidence, Mr. Steidtmann concludes, while cash flow drives spending. The twain may or may not meet.</br></br>After Sept. 11, consumer sentiment was buffeted by the terrorist attack, the anthrax mailings and fear of a second blow. But at the same time, cash flow was bolstered by lower interest rates, tax rebates, mortgage refinancings and lower energy prices.\n",

Another view holds that inflation is all diie to mismanagement of the money supply. A third attributes it to OPEC and oil prices.\t' -\"All of those things have contributed to inflation fjrom time to time over the years. None of them is the single crucial source of the trouble. The technical economic analyses never quite reach the heart of the matter. At its present stage, the inflation is rooted mainly in public attitudes. Not only the government but Americans throughout the country want better performance out of the economy than it is capable of giving. They want lower employment and better housing and bigger pensions and faster growth, simultaneously, than the great machine can provide.</br></br>Living in, a highly organized society, Americans have become skilled at protecting themselves from inflation. The cost of living has risen 10 percent in the past year, and people think it only fair that their incomes should go up 10 percent to compensate them. To the extent that people succeed in recapturing that 10 percent, it will turn up again in the months ahead in somebody elseÛªs costs and the inflation will continue.</br></br>\"To keep the inflation rate at zero, every rising price has to be balanced by a falling price somewhere else.</br></br>When any worker manages to push his wages up faster than his productivity, some other workerÛªs wage has to fall. But most American producers have a ratchet on their prices, and wage cuts are almost unknown. President CarterÛªs wage and price guidelines are a brave attempt to hold everybody to increases that are a little below the inflation rate, to distribute the burden as widely as possible. While the guidelines are better than nothing, they are hardly proving a miracle.\n",

The administration strongly opposes raising coverage from its current $100,000 per depositor per institution.</br></br>The move jeopardizes competing proposals, one that passed the House overwhelmingly last year and has been reintroduced by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael Oxley (R., Ohio) this year, and another sponsored by Sen. Tim Johnson (D., S.D.). Both would boost the limit to $130,000 and index coverage thereafter for inflation.</br></br>\"Coverage increases pose a serious threat to taxpayers that could far outweigh the marginal benefits to depositors or the banking system,\" Mr. Shelby said after hearing testimony from the Treasury and the four federal banking regulators, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</br></br>Except for FDIC Chairman Donald Powell, all oppose increasing coverage limits, arguing it would encourage banks to lend recklessly with the taxpayer underwriting the risk. All, however, agree on giving the FDIC more freedom to charge insurance premiums on banks that currently don't pay any, tailor premium levels to a bank's riskiness, limit the tendency of premiums to fall in good times and rise in bad times, and merge the bank and thrift insurance funds.\n",

            "TEXT --->  Alan Greenspan has endorsed tax cuts and the new Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, is on board as well after having waffled a bit in his confirmation testimony. Mr. O'Neill had argued that lower interest rates, not taxes, were the first line of defense against a slowing economy. He will be pleased if the Fed gratifies widespread expectations and trims its short-term rate target again this week. He also now says he will carry the tax-cut banner with pride. With Bill Clinton out of the way, some congressional Democrats have become tax-cutters as well.</br></br>The administration of George W. Bush is only in its second week, but all the political harmony in Washington is so unnatural as to be disconcerting. Even the New York Times has overcome its reluctance to admit that Bush is a legitimate president and was marveling Sunday on what a smooth transition the Bushites were conducting. No doubt things would have been even smoother for transition manager Dick Cheney if Al Gore's staffers hadn't trashed the vice presidential offices Mr. Cheney was preparing to occupy. But kids will be kids.</br></br>The honeymoon won't last, of course. The docility of the Democrats has been prompted in part by fears that the only legacy left behind by the Clinton presidency was a collapsing economy. They would have had to worry less if Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had boasted far less that this was an economy they themselves had \"grown.\" But the now-departed chief exec and veep were merely behaving like politicians.</br></br>Don't tell the amiable Democrats this, but their worst fears may not be justified. Even if they are, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore deserve only a part of the blame, just as they deserve only a modicum of credit for the economic surge they claimed as their handiwork when the 20th century was going out like a lion. The late 1990s boom was the product of an entrepreneurial, high-tech explosion in which productivity rose dramatically and a new consumer product, the personal computer, came into its own. Last fall, the boom simply ran out of gas after consumers had used up most of their credit and corporations could no longer keep stock prices pumped up by borrowing money to buy up their own shares.</br></br>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, held in check by Congress, were not able to contribute much to the debacle. That's if you don't count the not inconsiderable regulatory mischief they inflicted before making their rather ungracious departures. Or their resistance to tax-cut proposals that, if enacted a year ago, might have headed off the current slowdown. It's a bit early to grant them absolution, particularly with regard to energy policy, but a little generosity never hurts.\n",

Take this week, for example.</br></br>On Monday, fresh from Easter recess, the Senate began considering a $1.1 trillion federal budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Yet, aside from the opening ceremonies, it was not until late yesterday that the talk got around to the spending blueprint under consideration.</br></br>Instead, the Senate spent the better part of three days socked in under a series of amendments to take various federal trust funds \"off budget\" for purposes of computing the federal deficit. The exercise began with an amendment by Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) expressing the sense of Congress that surpluses building up in the Social Security Trust Fund should not be used in figuring the size of the nation's monstrous budget deficit.</br></br>Chiles' amendment goes to the heart of an accounting debate that has a long history, and which is likely to get louder as the trust fund reserves continue to grow in coming years to cover the benefits obligated to future Social Security beneficiaries. Chiles and others argue that the surplus tends to obscure the true extent of the federal deficit and gives an unrealistic view of the task of bringing the budget into balance.</br></br>As if deficits in the range of $170 billion weren't enough, the true deficit, Chiles said, is about $220 billion, because the Social Security Trust Fund surplus next fiscal year will be about $46 billion. His amendment, Chiles said, is designed to \"clear off the haze so we can see all the deficit, and deal with it head-on.\"\n",

            "TEXT --->  I read with much interest the article about the Supreme Court raising its fee limit for court-appointed attorneys in capital cases to $5,000 {Jan. 25.} While I share some of the anger and indignation of Vivian Berger, the Columbia Law professor who \"won\" the increase, I also believe her anger is somewhat misdirected.</br></br>As a law student at Georgetown University who plans to serve indigent clients when I graduate, I know all too well the dearth of legal resources for have-nots. In addition to the fact that the pay is incredibly low (in many cases probably lower than the $17 per hour Vivian Berger received in her case), the funding is so limited that many lawyers who would like to practice in the Public Defender Service or legal services agencies must be turned away.</br></br>But with all this inequity, I'm not really sure the government is the best place to seek change. Certainly Vivian Berger was correct in stating that the Supreme Court sends a powerful message in setting attorney fees. But those cases are paid for by the government of a country that is in a recession and that has proved quite well that it cannot manage its finances. Meanwhile, she is surrounded in New York (as we are here in Washington) by hundreds if not thousands of lawyers who are charging $395 per hour. I have yet to meet a human being whose abilities are worth $395 an hour. Isn't there a better way to spend that kind of money?</br></br>In theory, lawyers are to adhere to standards of professional responsibility. I quote from the ABA's Model Code of Professional Responsibility, Ethical Consideration 2-25: \"Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional workload, should find time to participate in serving the disadvantaged. The rendition of free legal services to those unable to pay reasonable fees continues to be an obligation of each lawyer, but the efforts of individual lawyers are often not enough to meet the need.\"</br></br>Now, I suspect that most of the lawyers in this country who are charging fees of $200 and up per hour have limited expertise in criminal law. But that need not foreclose their aid to indigent clients. Through their firms, they could establish legal defense funds: they could hire one or more associates per year who would specialize in criminal defense and thereby carry the bulk of the firm's legal aid obligation. They could target current associates and partners with an interest in criminal law, free them for additional training if needed and credit their billable time for their efforts on behalf of indigents - without limit. And criminal law need not be the only area in which law firms do more.\n",

Morgan buy Bear Stearns, the deal raised sufficient and legitimate questions of public interest to justify Senator Chris Dodd and his Senate Banking Committee brethren getting up close and personal with Ben Bernanke and the rest of the boys who did the deal. No one should expect Congress to regard this as a once- only date.</br></br>Details that emerged from the hearing offered a better understanding of the high drama during the days of the sale. These particulars make us inclined to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt on doing the basic deal to forestall systemic risk. We remain unconvinced about the new precedent of the government holding $29 billion in mortgage- related securities as collateral.</br></br>As described, the Fed learned from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday evening March 13 that Bear would have to declare bankruptcy the next morning. That Thursday, according to SEC Chairman Chris Cox, Bear's liquidity dropped to $2 billion from $12 billion. That would focus anyone's mind. Bear's customers and counterparties were accelerating their refusal to deal with the bank. As Mr. Cox summarized: \"Run\" isn't normally associated with investment banks, but \"the analogy is nearly complete.\"</br></br>At the most basic level of justification -- that Bear's collapse posed a systemic risk to both the financial market and the broader economy -- the regulators made a plausible case for their actions that weekend. But once past this first-order goal, we find much in the testimony to merit concern.</br></br>Exhibit A remains that mammoth guarantee by the Fed to finance billions in illiquid Bear assets. The best face we can put on this decision, based on what was said yesterday, is that the regulators considered the $30 billion to be chump change against the larger, immediate threat to the system. Then as a gesture of mitigation, J.P. Morgan took on the first billion of potential losses from the assets.\n",

By 2008, the White House forecasts that the deficit will fall to $162 billion, or 1.1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).

Wage and benefit costs may be turning up. Boeing Co. can't make planes fast enough. The nation's railroads can't make timely deliveries. Business executives appear dangerously euphoric and, at least until last week, so did stock-market investors. What more will it take for Alan Greenspan to pull the interest-rate trigger?</br></br>A lot, apparently.</br></br>There is little doubt Federal Reserve officials would fall in line if Mr. Greenspan opened their Nov. 12 meeting by calling for higher rates, a step he hasn't taken since March. The published summary of the Fed's August meeting, the most recent available, is full of fretting about \"the risks of rising inflation.\"</br></br>Other Fed officials caution that when things look too good to be true, they probably are. \"The economy's performance over the last year or so-the extraordinary combination of above-trend growth, exceptionally tight labor markets, but continued low inflation-has been much more favorable than I and many others expected,\" Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said the other day. \"Speaking strictly for myself, I am doubtful it can continue indefinitely.\"</br></br>All this is irrelevant if the stock market crashes. The Fed flooded the economy with credit after the 1987 crash and surely would do so again.\n",

            "TEXT --->  San Francisco -- Perhaps no one on the globe has come to symbolize the rise of the investor class in America in recent decades more than Charles Schwab.</br></br>When Mr. Schwab, or \"Chuck,\" as nearly everyone calls him, opened his first brokerage office in 1971, the stock market was pretty much the exclusive sandbox of the richest 5-10% of Americans. Today, thanks in no small part to his company's financial market innovations, investing has been thoroughly \"democratized,\" as he puts it, with more than half of working class adults now owners of stock.</br></br>Creating wealth is what Mr. Schwab has come to regard as his \"life's pursuit.\" He's accomplished that not just for himself -- his stake in the company is estimated at $4 billion -- but also for the millions of small investors who first came to be owner-capitalists by opening a Schwab account. So who better to discuss the future of financial markets and investing than the man who revolutionized the brokerage business?</br></br>I visited Mr. Schwab recently at the firm's headquarters in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Mr. Schwab is astonishingly muscular and fit for a grandfather who turns 70 this weekend. Throughout our conversation -- which took place in his 30th-floor office overlooking the Bay -- he is cordial but intense. He speaks of the company as if it is one of his children, and he doesn't seem to be in any hurry to surrender the helm.</br></br>I ask him what he means by his favorite term, \"democratic capitalism.\" He replies that the stock market today is \"an open tent for anybody to come into.\" Ever the salesman, he adds: \"For as little as a thousand dollars, you can open an account at Schwab. I mean, it's not a big barrier to entry.\"\n",

            "TEXT --->  The \"surprise\" jump in producer and consumer price inflation is not a surprise when you understand the political and economic logic of using one nation's domestic currency -- the U.S. dollar -- as international money. Domestically oriented analysts have been fooled because U.S. inflation responds to the world-wide supply of dollars, not just those in the U.S.</br></br>The Bush administration fervently hopes the latest figures are just an aberration. Such arguments must be used with caution. (The Carter administration used to tell us that if you took away food, energy and housing, the underlying rate of inflation was only 9%.) True, the price of crude oil jumped more than $5 a barrel from November to January. But analysts knew what oil prices were, and they were still surprised. Moreover, oil prices fell sharply for most of 1988 without a fall in the inflation rate. Everything points to a broader acceleration of inflation.</br></br>While some point to rising wages or energy costs, the main cause of the current inflation is the past expansion of what my forecasting firm calls the \"world dollar base\" -- the stock of high-powered money (currency plus bank reserves) in the U.S., plus the dollars held by foreign central banks. The world dollar base is key because the world operates on a kind of \"dollar standard.\" Other currencies are no longer pegged to the dollar. But most currencies, including the Japanese yen and West German mark, are backed with dollars, as currencies once were backed by gold reserves. The dollar shared this role with gold under the Bretton Woods monetary system of 1944-71. But since 1971, the dollar has been the unchallenged \"reserve currency,\" even with somewhat greater use of the yen and the mark by small countries.</br></br>This change had an important, but overlooked, consequence for the U.S. \"twin deficits\": budget and trade. Under the dollar standard -- as under a gold standard -- the rest of the world must consume and invest less than its income in order to acquire reserves (sought for reasons I shall note). In economic jargon, this is called running an overall \"balance-of-payments surplus.\" It's analogous to the fact that to put more cash in your wallet, you must pay out less than you earn, beg or borrow.</br></br>But it's different for the reserve-currency country. If other countries increase their dollar reserves, the U.S. must pay out more than it receives -- run a chronic \"balance-of-payments deficit.\" To get a rough idea of the difference, imagine that everyone carried your personal checks around in his wallet instead of money. You wouldn't need to carry any cash -- just your checkbook. And with so many of your checks floating around permanently uncashed, you would always have a fat checking-account balance at your disposal, far beyond what you had saved.\n",

            "TEXT --->  MADRID -- With more than $100 billion of deals proposed in the past two years, Europe's giant utilities have one of the world's biggest cases of merger mania. Just yesterday two European companies culminated a messy battle and agreed to a $58.27 billion bid for Spain's Endesa SA.</br></br>Behind all the deals is a big collision between Europe's new push for a unified marketplace and the national pride of Europe's politicians. Starting July 1, the European Union's power sector will be officially flung open to competition, allowing utility companies from any of the bloc's 27 member nations to sell electricity in any other.</br></br>By unshackling the energy sector, European regulators hoped to boost competition and lay the foundation for stronger growth on the continent. They wanted to inject the continent's electricity marketplace with new players that would spur cheaper energy prices.</br></br>But that vision has bumped up against a messy reality: Politicians in European capitals are reluctant to loosen their grip on the state- run national champions that dominate strategic sectors. Rather than invest in new capacity, transmission lines and other upgrades, the dominant players have instead been bulking up for a wave of mergers.</br></br>Big utilities are scrambling to buy up assets from Bulgaria to Scotland in a mad dash to get bigger when the deregulatory rules come into full effect. Last year, Paris rushed a merger between French utility Suez SA and Gaz de France SA, though the pact has hit legal and political hurdles and the outcome is unclear. Earlier this year, two midsize power companies in the Netherlands, Essent NV and Nuon NV, said they would tie the knot. Spain's Iberdrola SA will complete its $24 billion friendly takeover of Scottish Power PLC in the United Kingdom this month, making it the world's biggest marketer of renewable energy sources such as wind power.\n",

You can go higher than that if you install energy-efficient improvements, but cannot borrow more than 110% of either the value of the property plus the cost of rehab, or the appraised value of the property after rehab, whichever is less. You'd have to make up any shortfall. (For more rules on this program, see the Housing and Urban Development.)\n",

            "TEXT --->  The Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 decision to stay the course on its asset purchases surprised and confused many market participants, who felt the central bank had sent contradictory signals about its intentions. In fact, the Fed has behaved in a way completely consistent with Chairman Ben Bernanke's public comments, at least since July. A careful look at the labor market numbers suggests that if the Fed sticks to the chairman's words, there will be no significant tapering any time soon.</br></br>Before July, the Fed announced on a number of occasions that a 6.5% unemployment rate would indicate that it is time to start raising interest rates and winding down its easy-money policies. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its high of 10% in October 2009 to the mid-sevens. But the labor market is still sickly because, as I pointed out in these pages in June, the employment rate--the proportion of the working-age population that has jobs--has made little progress.</br></br>The employment rate is the best single indicator of labor-market health, and it is still hovering at around 58.5%, down significantly from its pre-recession levels of over 63%. The economy is adding jobs, but just barely staying ahead of population growth. Rather than making up for ground lost during the recession, the economy is still treading water.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke and other Fed governors are clearly aware of the distinction between the unemployment and employment rates. In his July 17 congressional testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that \"if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment (my emphasis), the [Federal Open Market] Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6.5% as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate.\" The jobs report for August showed the decline in labor-force participation and employment rates that the Fed feared.</br></br>On Sept. 18--following the FOMC's vote to continue its current pace of bond-buying--Mr. Bernanke reinforced the message. \"The unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure in all circumstances of the state of the labor market overall,\" he said. \"We are looking for overall improvement in the labor market.\"\n",

Older-skewing CBS, a unit of CBS Corp., was down 9.6 percent among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49. News Corporation's Fox and The CW, a joint venture between CBS Corp. and Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros., were both up over last year, but still ranked Nos. 4 and 5 in viewers among the English-language networks, respectively.</br></br>Network executives blame an array of factors for the low ratings, including the increased penetration of DVRs; the availability of broadcast network shows online; the fragmentation of the TV audience; and high interest in the presidential election and the economic crisis, which is drawing viewers away from prime-time programming toward news channels and the Internet.\n",

            "TEXT --->  NEW YORK -- A forecaster doesn't have to be especially fearless right now to predict, as most are doing, that inflation will worsen considerably over the next year or so. Business-cycle history suggests it. Indicators that normally presage broad price trends suggest it. The truly fearless forecaster now is the one who maintains that inflation won't worsen markedly in coming months. There are quite a number of them around, and their thinking, however wishful it may ultimately prove to be, seems worth reciting.</br></br>It may be useful, first, to underline the considerable derring-do that a forecast of low inflation entails. It runs counter to the fact that inflation has worsened in year number three of nearly every long-running economic expansion of the past 30 years. And the reacceleration has often been pronounced. The sharpest speedup was in year three of the 1970-73 upturn, when the overall inflation rate jumped to 7.1% from 4.3% in year two. The current expansion, it should be noted, is in the middle of its second year.</br></br>A footnote: The postwar record shows that inflation has normally been milder in the second expansion year than in the first. This tendency reflects such usual early-recovery trends as above-average productivity gains, which serve to hold down labor costs, and an absence of costly bottlenecks.</br></br>Apart from the business cycle, a wide assortment of inflation barometers point to increasing trouble on the price front. Reasonably typical is an indicator compiled by Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research. Reflecting such facets of the business scene as credit growth, commodity price movements and employment trends, it has surged some 17% since the expansion's start. That's the sharpest recovery rise in three decades and suggests to the Columbia analysts that prices generally will be sharply rising by late this year or early next. They foresee annual inflation rates of 8% or 9%. That would be roughly double recent rates.</br></br>Most forecasters, to be sure, are somewhat less pessimistic about the price outlook. But not by a great deal. A recent survey of several dozen forecasters by Eggert Enterprises Inc. of Sedona, Ariz., shows that on average they anticipate steadily accelerating inflation through this year and next, with the annual rate approaching 7%. That would be up from an estimated rise of 4.9% for the current quarter.\n",

Both work especially well for \"jumbo\" loan borrowers -- those seeking mortgages of more than $227,000 -- and for buyers who know they're likely to sell or move sometime in the coming four to five years.</br></br>But both require you to strike a bargain of sorts with your lender.

After that, you're free to do whatever you want. And during those first 60 months, you are free to pay off the mortgage loan without penalty if you move or sell the house.</br></br>But if you prepay the mortgage balance simply to refinance with another lender, you get hit with a penalty, the size of which varies according to state law. In California, for example, the prepayment penalty can't exceed 80 percent of six months' interest. In other states, where such prepayment penalties are subject to different statutory restrictions, the penalty may be different, or not permitted at all.\n",

But Jean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi, is betting his company on the dicey prospect that a transatlantic hodgepodge of European and American assets can indeed produce synergy--and make real money.</br></br>Messier yesterday delivered the formal announcement of his $34 billion mega-deal to buy the Canadian drinks and entertainment company Seagram, which owns Universal studios and Polygram records. His hope is to make the merged \"Vivendi Universal\" into a Paris- based media company that will play in the same monster league with AOL-Time Warner.</br></br>A comment by Messier at yesterday's press conference made it clear that one factor behind this deal is France's decades-old insecurity about the reach of America's cultural imperialism. \"For the first time in Europe, there is a communication group of a size that will be able to rival all the American giants,\" Messier boasted. Maybe so. But many a would-be entertainment baron has stumbled in the pursuit of Hollywood's irresistibly glamorous assets. Just ask the Japanese company Matsushita, which a decade ago was seduced into buying MCA, which it later sold in frustration to Seagram, which Seagram is now selling in frustration to Vivendi. When it comes to the entertainment business, it seems, there always is one more sucker.</br></br>Even by recent standards of the merger-crazed business world, this one is a high-risk combination. It's premised on the belief that immense \"scale\" is essential to compete in today's economy. That remains a shaky proposition, in my book. Insiders say that even before the planned merger with AOL, Time Warner was an almost unmanageable collection of rival princes running their own fiefdoms. Add to that the difficulty of combining Paris and Hollywood--Gerard Depardieu and Julia Roberts--and you have a truly daunting challenge.</br></br>\"The chance of the French succeeding in running a U.S. music and film business properly is about zero,\" one analyst told Reuters news service yesterday. The stock market certainly agrees with that gloomy assessment. Since news of the deal leaked last week, Vivendi's stock has fallen about 22 percent, including a 7 percent drop yesterday, according to the Associated Press. That drop reflects investors' doubts that Vivendi can make enough money from the deal to recover the premium it paid for Seagram, headed by Edgar Bronfman Jr.\n",

            "TEXT --->  We should not fool ourselves that the recent sell-offs in world stock markets simply reflect a nervous reaction to Russia's turmoil or a long-overdue \"correction.\" They signify instead a gathering fear that the global economy is drifting toward a dangerous slump, driven by forces that world leaders only vaguely understand and seem powerless to affect. Even those supposed titans of global finance -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- give little hint publicly that they grasp the threat or know what to do about it.</br></br>This is no longer a minor \"Asian\" crisis. Japan's recession is its worst since World War II. Latin America's economies are slowing. \"Mexico's economy -- which had been growing 4 to 5 percent -- will be lucky to grow 2 percent next year,\" says economist Desmond Lachman of Salomon Smith Barney. Russia's depression hurts its Eastern European trading partners. China is slowing. Together, these areas represent almost half the world economy's output. The United States and Europe, with another 40 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), cannot easily escape the fallout.</br></br>Given today's prosperity, Americans are naturally disbelieving. Unemployment is 4.5 percent. Inflation barely exists. Exports -- the sector directly affected by the global slump -- are only 12 percent of U.S. GDP. But economists (and others) often blunder by projecting the present into the future. America's prosperity is precarious precisely because things can't get better; they could easily get worse.</br></br>How? The economic expansion began in 1991. Americans have already bought lots of cars, computers and clothes. Consumer debt (including home loans) is high. In the first half of 1998, the personal savings rate was less than one percent. Until recently, the jubilant stock market made Americans feel wealthier. They are spending some of their stock profits; since 1992, annual realized \"capital gains\" have roughly tripled. Now, lower stock prices could dampen confidence and consumer spending, which is two-thirds of GDP. Exports are already weakening; rising imports further imperil domestic production. Why, then, would companies continue to increase investment (11 percent of GDP)? A recession is clearly possible.</br></br>And a U.S. slump would compound everyone else's problems. The United States is the world's largest importer, and other countries -- from South Korea to Brazil -- need to export to recover. Lower interest rates would improve the outlook. Economist Gary Hufbauer of the Council on Foreign Relations rightly says that the Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank should cut rates by half a percentage point. Lower rates would ease debt burdens and help sustain consumer spending and home-buying.\n",

            "TEXT --->  It's an election year, and partisan acrimony has escalated. Democrats and Republicans portray themselves as the nation's saviors against all the programmatic atrocities of the other side. Can we find a refuge of common-sense agreement amid this self-serving political din? Well, here's a proposal for the economy: Enact a temporary extension of unemployment insurance from the standard 26 weeks to 39 weeks.</br></br>The proposal's virtue is precisely its modesty. Benefits have been extended in every recession except one since the 1950s. Although most unemployed usually find new jobs within the normal six months, the task becomes harder in a slump. Perhaps 3 million people will exhaust their benefits this year, estimates the Congressional Budget Office. The cost of added protection is also modest: about $13 billion for a proposal that recently passed the House Ways and Means Committee.</br></br>True, it's not yet clear that we're even in a recession. In the first quarter of 2008, the economy's output of goods and services (gross domestic product) increased at a 0.6 percent annual rate. Though meager, that's still growth and suggests the economy doesn't meet one basic test for a recession -- two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. But that verdict comes with a big caveat: The job market is already in retreat.</br></br>Look at the numbers. Though the April unemployment rate of 5 percent is not historically high (the average for the 1990s was 5.8 percent), it's way up from the recent low of 4.4 percent in October 2006. For much of 2007, the number of new jobs was actually increasing, though not fast enough to absorb all the new entrants into the labor force. Even this growth has halted, and the number of jobs has begun to decline. Since December, payroll employment has fallen by 260,000.</br></br>How does employment decline in an economy that's expanding, even if feebly? Easy. Weak companies fail or shrink; the survivors don't hire more people to handle the extra business. Productivity (a.k.a. efficiency) improves. Fewer workers do more work. By many indicators, the job situation may get worse before it gets better.\n",

            "TEXT --->  NEW YORK -- The economy continues to edge higher, and the consensus forecast is that the gains will continue, at least through 1988. The stock market, which moved upward last year mainly because of lower interest rates, now seems to be focusing mainly on an expectation of better corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the dollar is showing new weakness, the budget deficit isn't sinking very much, and a revival of inflation begins to look like a realistic possibility.</br></br>That's more or less the situation the Federal Open Market Committee will confront next month as it meets to plan monetary policy for 1987. What will the committee decide to do?</br></br>It may not matter very much. Last February the FOMC decided that M1, the narrowly defined money supply, should grow at a rate between 3% and 8% in 1987. In July the committee reaffirmed that range but also said that growth in excess of 3% to 8% would be \"acceptable.\" It's a good thing the committee left itself some leeway, since the actual growth rate was about 17%.</br></br>But the committee, whose voting members are the Federal Reserve governors and five of the regional Reserve Bank presidents, is required by law to say something. Composing the statement will be a little more difficult than usual this time, since the Fed seems to have gotten itself into a box.</br></br>Through last year the Federal Reserve was under pressure from the Reagan administration to force interest rates lower, depreciate the dollar and stimulate economic growth. Chairman Paul Volcker made occasional noises to the effect that a falling dollar could be inflationary, but by and large the Fed went along. After all, the consumer price index last year rose at an annual rate of 1.1%, so why worry about inflation?\n",

            "TEXT --->  INFLATION. DEFLATION. Disinflation. The economic lexicon is garbled with so many 'flations these days, it's getting a little hard to make sense of them all. During the 1970s, '80s and '90s, Washington policy makers waged a persistent battle against inflation, broadly defined as rising consumer prices. But for most of this year, as the inflation rate has fallen closer to zero, economists began to worry about the opposite trend -- the possibility that the U.S. could face Japan-style deflation, or falling consumer prices.</br></br>As we enter 2003, here comes a new watchword: reflation. The term refers to government efforts to pump up -- or reflate -- an economy that is stuck in a slump by flooding that economy with money. Essentially, reflation is the intentional effort by governments to ward off deflation by boosting demand and underpinning prices. Though it isn't quite the same as inflation, reflation can spark inflation problems if policy makers go too far.</br></br>The term is popping up often. In a recent report titled \"The Reflation Trade,\" Morgan Stanley Co. chief economist Stephen Roach argued that policy makers are now in a \"full-scale frontal assault on the perils of deflation.\" That has made him more bullish on the stock market in the months ahead. James Grant, in his twice-monthly newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, writes about a \"global reflation program\" being led by the U.S. and spreading world-wide. That, he said, explains why prices for gold -- a hedge against inflation and his favorite investment -- are on the rise.</br></br>SOME ECONOMISTS who have been beating deflation drums are doing an about-face. \"There has been an important shift. The financial community is talking more about reflation . . . it is the thing to watch in 2003,\" says Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., the California bond-fund manager that recently advised clients that government-bond yields will rise as result of today's reflation tilt.</br></br>Behind the reflation focus is blunt talk by Federal Reserve officials. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told economists in New York that while deflation is only a remote possibility, the central bank is \"extraordinarily sensitive\" to the potential perils associated with it and is prepared to forestall it if the economy moves further in that direction. In November, Fed governor Ben Bernanke laid out a series of unusual steps the Fed could take to get out of Japan-style deflation if it did happen -- such as lending more aggressively to banks to drive down private borrowing costs or buying foreign government bonds, which could weaken the dollar and boost exports.\n",

Trading soared beyond 127 million shares, the largest volume since Feb. 9. The increasing breadth of the rally also was indicated by a sharp jump in the ratio of gainers to losers. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange topped losers by more than 4-to-1.

Government figures showed declines in both factory orders and construction spending in June, offering further support to the market's hopes for a slowdown in economic growth leading to lower interest rates. In addition, the bond market displayed what many traders termed surprising strength, with long-term Treasury bonds jumping nearly a point in morning trading.</br></br>After the first half-hour, the industrial average was up more than seven points, and it continued to climb steadily until late afternoon. At that point, the average stumbled a bit, which was attributed to profittaking, then the rally resumed to the close.\n",

            "TEXT --->  Author: Peter D. Schiff</br></br>Most economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders \"underwater.\" As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.</br></br>Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the \"robo-signing\"-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a \"double dip\" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.</br></br>Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.</br></br>By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit.\n",

The record drop in heating oil prices last month followed a 26.3% jump in January. Overall energy prices fell 0.7% in February after jumping 5.1% in January. Food prices, which soared 1.8% in January after the cold wave destroyed crops, grew 0.5% in February.</br></br>Many economists said that despite the retreat from January's sharp advance, February still leaves inflation worrisomely high.</br></br>\"I think this shows inflation is a very stubborn problem,\" said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. \"There is simply no evidence as yet that the Federal Reserve has been able to bring down the core rate of inflation.\"\n",

These pension plans, once a drag on earnings, are boosting the financial performance of many of the country's best-known companies.</br></br>The pension-fund bubble stems from the arcane accounting rules that govern the more than $1 trillion in private pensions. Under those rules, companies make assumptions about how much they will earn on their pension assets, how much they will have to pay out to future retirees and the future level of interest rates.</br></br>But what has been happening during the long bull market is that those assumptions have proved too conservative -- and the funds have swollen far beyond expectations as stock market returns have outpaced historical trends.</br></br>The excess, filtered through many layers of accounting, is dribbling down to the bottom line. And that's giving an extra boost to corporate profits at a time when earnings are being squeezed from lack of pricing power and rising wage pressures. Some companies are siphoning off some of the pension surplus to pay for other corporate needs, such as early-retirement plans, retiree health benefits and even merger financing.</br></br>For many businesses, the gain is twofold: Their plans are so flush they are being spared from having to make new annual contributions, and they are earning income from the excess that has built up throughout the stock market's rise.\n",

But the tuition increases outpaced both the 3.5% annualized increase in the consumer price index for the first eight months of this year, and year-earlier price increases.</br></br>The College Board said student aid rose 4% to $68 billion, but the aid data lag behind the college-cost survey by a year.</br></br>Room-and-board costs increased by an average 5.1% to $4,960 at public colleges and by 4.2% to $6,209 at private schools. Mr. Caperton attributed the increases in both tuition and housing to students \"demanding more,\" including a lower student-teacher ratio, better housing and increased technology spending.\n",

To make it easier for developers to get financing for high-rises with below-market units, the council voted to allow more units on available land by relaxing height restrictions and green space requirements.</br></br>The council also voted to increase the amount of time that below- market housing is required to remain in the program, so that the county can retain as many affordable units as possible as developable land dwindles. Rental units will have to remain in the program for 99 years, up from 20 years, and for-sale units will have to remain 30 years, up from 10 years.</br></br>Council President Steven A. Silverman (D-At Large) said downtown high-rises with moderately priced units might be one or two stories higher under the new rules.</br></br>\"I think people will accept a couple more floors on a building if that means more affordable housing in Montgomery County,\" Silverman said. \"The people who work in Montgomery County ought to have a fair shot at living in Montgomery County.\"\n",

            "TEXT --->  When President Obama needed a business executive to come to his campaign defense, Jim Sinegal was there. The Costco co-founder, director and former CEO even made a prime-time speech at the Democratic Party convention in Charlotte. So what a surprise this week to see that Mr. Sinegal and the rest of the Costco board voted to give themselves a special dividend to avoid Mr. Obama's looming tax increase. Is this what the President means by \"tax fairness\"?</br></br>Specifically, the giant retailer announced Wednesday that the company will pay a special dividend of $7 a share this month. That's a $3 billion Christmas gift for shareholders that will let them be taxed at the current dividend rate of 15%, rather than next year's rate of up to 43.4% -- an increase to 39.6% as the Bush-era rates expire plus another 3.8% from the new ObamaCare surcharge.</br></br>More striking is that Costco also announced that it will borrow $3.5 billion to finance the special payout. Dividends are typically paid out of earnings, either current or accumulated. But so eager are the Costco executives to get out ahead of the tax man that they're taking on debt to do so.</br></br>Shareholders were happy as they bid up shares by more than 5% in two days. But the rating agencies were less thrilled, as Fitch downgraded Costco's credit to A+ from AA-. Standard & Poor's had been watching the company for a potential upgrade but pulled the watch on the borrowing news.</br></br>We think companies can do what they want with their cash, but it's certainly rare to see a public corporation weaken its balance sheet not for investment in the future but to make a one-time equity payout. It's a good illustration of the way that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's near-zero interest rates are combining with federal tax policy to distort business decisions.\n",

That's slightly higher than the 3% and 3.6% consensus forecasts from Blue Chip Economic Indicators.</br></br>Still, the overall drop in the jobless rate set off alarms at the Federal Reserve, which remains worried that desperate employers will boost wages and benefits to attract or retain workers, triggering inflation. The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 to slow the economy, though it has kept rates steady at its past three meetings.</br></br>Many analysts said that before raising rates again this year, the central bank would have to see a similar decline in next month's jobs data, alongside a clearer indication that labor costs were rising.\n",

            "TEXT --->  With the sort of attention usually reserved for royal weddings, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve convenes today and tomorrow to determine whether or not to leave the current federal funds rate unchanged. In the course of their deliberations, which closely resemble an academic seminar, the Fed governors will take into account everything from the unexpectedly large increase in the April consumer price index to its benign follow-up in May to Japan's first-quarter growth. The probable result of all this activity: a rate hike of one-quarter of one percentage point.</br></br>Why so much attention to an event once known only to Fed watchers at investment banks? The reason has little to do with whether and by how much the Fed raises the rate, though this will of course have some bearing on the immediate direction of the markets. What really matters, however, is what the Fed's action suggests about its view of the future of inflation.</br></br>After decades in which mainstream economists held that the costs of inflation were negligible, and that an inflationary monetary policy could stimulate economic growth, it is now widely appreciated (thanks to the work of Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Martin Feldstein and others) that stable, low inflation is essential to longer expansions and stronger growth. Thus the intense speculation: Will tomorrow be the start of another \"long march,\" a 300 basis point increase such as began in 1988 and 1994 to ward off inflation? Is the Fed going to reverse the 75 basis point decrease in interest rates in response to the last year's global turmoil and the prospect of deflation?</br></br>The change in forecasts of what the Fed will and should do has been rapid. As recently as late February, the Economist magazine ran a cover story worrying about the risk of global deflation; a few weeks later it hawkishly editorialized that the Fed was late in raising interest rates. Behind these large swings in opinion lie some unresolved questions about the economy, among them:</br></br>-- Why has inflation continued to decelerate? Is it due to a string of one-time favorable \"shocks,\" such as low oil prices, a strong dollar, and a steeper than anticipated decline in computer prices? Has that string run out?\n",

Along with risky bonds and anything connected to the housing market, investors sold off stocks, emerging-markets bonds and even high-quality corporate debt. The record trading volume in stocks reflected rising anxiety.</br></br>Meanwhile, roughly 1,300, or nearly 17%, of the around 7,800 stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges hit their lowest price of the past 12 months.</br></br>To many investors, that made yesterday's selloff more ominous than other big declines this year. Sid Bakst, a senior portfolio manager at investment firm Robeco Weiss, Peck & Greer, said the steady drip of bad news on subprime-mortgage loans and the failure of some leveraged buyouts to get long-term financing has made investors increasingly nervous.</br></br>\"As each day has gone by, things have been leaking a bit more,\" Mr. Bakst said. \"But today there was full-blown carnage.\"\n",

            "TEXT --->  BUENOS AIRES -- Four months after Brazil's devaluation, Argentina's recession drags on as companies struggle with high costs and a U.S. dollar-pegged exchange-rate system that many believe is still essential to economic stability.</br></br>Despite weakened currencies in just about every major Latin American economy in the past five years, Argentina has hung on doggedly to its link to the dollar. The so-called Convertibility Plan, in which the dollar peg plays a key part, extinguished Argentine inflation and provided a base of stability that allowed the economy to grow at an average annual rate of 5.8% between 1991 and 1998. But because the dollar peg means Argentina can't weaken its currency to make its exports more competitive, it has to find ways to lower the cost of production.</br></br>Economists say the government hasn't complemented the currency system with policies that lower costs for businesses, and that may be delaying economic recovery. \"If the government is going to say that convertibility is a sacred cow, they have to build competitiveness,\" says Pedro Lacoste, whose Buenos Aires economic-research firm bears his name. \"It's a tough agenda with powerful interests against it. But whoever the next finance minister is, he better be very convinced about these issues.\"</br></br>In the early 1990s, Argentina increased competitiveness, Mr. Lacoste says, by slashing export taxes and liberalizing port regulations. But the government's attention now seems to be diverted by political shadow plays in a presidential election year. Some new tax policies appear to be working against competitiveness. In an announcement of default yesterday, power generator Central Termica Guemes SA said it wouldn't make a $3.6 million interest payment in part because of \"new taxes levied by the Argentine government on assets and on cash interest payments.\"</br></br>Mr. Lacoste estimates that gross domestic product will fall 3% this year, while exports decline around 12%. Yesterday, the government said auto production fell 51% in April from the same month a year earlier; electricity consumption fell 9% in the same period. \"The government and some economists were betting on a recovery in the second quarter; it is just not happening yet,\" says Martin Lousteau, an economist who works with Mr. Lacoste.\n",

            "TEXT --->  THE MORTGAGE industry is starting to make the move from short to long.</br></br>Lenders are rolling out a new crop of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages that let homeowners make low, interest-only payments for as long as 10 or 15 years. It is the latest effort to snare borrowers seeking lower monthly payments. Also getting a new push: mortgages that stretch for as long as 40 years.</br></br>The newest crop of products is largely aimed at borrowers who are looking for lower payments but are also concerned about interest-rate risk. In recent months, mortgage experts have been surprised by the continued strong interest in adjustable-rate mortgages at a time when borrowers can still lock in a fixed-rate loan at rates well below 6%. With rising short-term interest rates reducing the relative attractiveness of adjustable loans, lenders are seeing greater interest in loans that protect borrowers from rising interest rates -- and are introducing products for that market.</br></br>Last month, Wells Fargo & Co. rolled out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that is interest-only for the first 10 or 15 years. The interest rate remains the same throughout the life of the loan, but the monthly payment is recalculated after the interest-only period ends so that the mortgage balance is paid off over the remaining 15 or 20 years. U.S. Bank Home Mortgage, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, plans to introduce a 20-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest-only feature for the first 10 years. Bank of America Corp., IndyMac Bancorp Inc. and LendingTree.com, a unit of IAC/InterActive Corp., all have fixed- rate interest-only mortgages in the works.</br></br>Forty-year mortgages -- which keep monthly payments down but cost more over the long term -- also are attracting more notice in the wake of Fannie Mae's recent decision to expand its purchases of these loans. First offered in the 1980s, 40-year loans account for less than 1% of mortgage originations, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. More banks may be willing to offer them now that they know they can be sold to Fannie Mae, which has been purchasing 40-year mortgages since September 2003 under a pilot program with 22 credit unions. Fannie will purchase both fixed- and adjustable-rate 40-year mortgages.\n",

            "TEXT --->  In the wake of Sept. 11, rich countries are being exhorted to spend more money on foreign aid. If income inequality has spawned terrorist movements, the thinking goes, then rich countries should shell out more to make the world safer. But enormous sums of aid for development have already been wasted over past decades. And different countries have different needs: Afghanistan's request for peacekeeping forces is a far cry from Argentina's entreaty for a financial bailout.</br></br>Easy as it might be to succumb to the cheap grace of writing checks, the Bush administration is proposing a more thoughtful approach to foreign aid. Its goals, to emphasize quality over quantity and to focus on measurable results, will no doubt antagonize the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, who prefer to help the world by soliciting more funds for their own budgets. Under the Bush plan, recipient nations will be asked to assume greater responsibility for their own economic decisions. Call it the tough love approach to global development.</br></br>One of the first steps is recognizing that economic growth must begin in the soil of basic security and the rule of law. In countries besieged by war and political instability, few have the luxury of focusing on improving their own prospects. \"I receive daily delegations from all over Afghanistan,\" notes Afghanistan's interim leader, Hamid Karzai. \"They all ask for security and peace more than education, health and development.\" Financial assistance that fights crime and promotes a functioning legal system is money well spent. But it can only succeed where a nation is committed to transparency and good governance.</br></br>Helping improve nations' productivity is another area where foreign assistance can help. Access to health care and education allows individuals to become contributors to the global economy rather than be left behind or remain perpetual burdens. Enrolling girls in school can literally double the potential work force. Likewise, money to provide vaccinations against infectious diseases or prevent the spread of AIDS not only relieves human misery, but changes the social and economic dynamics of stricken nations. In South Africa, the \"AIDS tax\" (the epidemic's cost) on business is as high as 10% per year.</br></br>Still, as nice as it all sounds, humanitarian aid to improve peoples' lives and give them the chance to be productive is an empty victory without opportunities for nations to capture the rewards of upgraded skills and lift themselves out of poverty. And much of that responsibility falls to local governments. No one is indifferent to scenes of desperate people in Argentina being injured or killed in riots caused by money meltdown and financial chaos. But as Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill points out, Argentine officials received some $60 billion in emergency assistance from the IMF and other sources, yet \"they just didn't reform.\" It is irresponsible to continue giving money to a government that violates the most basic commitment to its citizens.\n",

            "TEXT --->  The idea of \"rebalancing\" the world economy is simple. Before the financial crisis, some advanced countries (led by the United States) were overspending, and some poorer countries (led by China) were oversaving. The two offset each other. The big spenders ran large trade deficits, and the big savers ran large trade surpluses. Now, the financial crisis has dampened the overspending. If the big savers don't increase their spending, the world economy faces prolonged slow growth. Countries may battle each other for shares of that weak demand by managing exchange rates, subsidies or tariffs.</br></br>This is a formula for economic strife, whether called \"currency wars,\" protectionism or economic nationalism. As wealthy countries wrestle with stubborn unemployment (9.6 percent in the United States, 10.1 percent in France, 20.5 percent in Spain), it will become harder to resist policies that favor local businesses and workers, especially if other countries are doing the same. Avoiding this future is the central issue facing leaders of the Group of 20 economies when they meet this week in Seoul.</br></br>The world's second-largest economy has run blatantly mercantilist (that is, discriminatory) economic policies for years. The resulting huge trade surpluses boosted job growth and, while much of the world boomed, they were tolerated. In 2007, China's current account surplus (mainly trade) reached 11 percent of its economy (gross domestic product). But as China has moved up the value chain - from toys to telecommunications equipment - and as the world economy weakened, its surpluses have become more threatening to more countries.</br></br>Like Japan before it, China embraced an investment-led and export-led economic model, explains economist Eswar Prasad of Cornell University. Manufacturers receive subsidized land and energy; the exchange rate of the renminbi is controlled and kept depressed, making Chinese exports more competitive on world markets and making imports into China more expensive. Bank lending rates, regulated by government, are also kept low so that companies can borrow cheaply.</br></br>The result has been rapid, though lopsided, industrialization. Economic growth has averaged about 10 percent annually for several decades. In modernizing, China shut down or streamlined many inefficient state-owned enterprises; the job loss was substantial, 43 million from 1997 to 2004, says the World Bank. One appeal of new export-oriented companies was to replace those jobs.\n",

That's the message of his campaign for the Buffett Rule, which raises income-tax rates on millionaires to a minimum of 30%, and for the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. He wants to raise the highest income tax rate by 20%, double the rate on capital gains, add a new 3.8% tax on all capital earnings, and nearly triple the dividend tax rate.</br></br>All this will enhance \"economic efficiency,\" insists a White House economic report.

            "TEXT --->  Holman W. Jenkins Jr. (Business World, Jan. 19) posed the question, \"What exactly is the purpose of the federal makework project known as the public audit?\" The answer is that an audit provides reasonable assurance that the financial statements are not materially misstated. Audits make financial information more reliable by reducing the frequency and magnitude of errors and fraud. Controversy arises over how much assurance auditors should provide at a reasonable cost. Victims of fraud argue that every fraud should have been detected. Auditors argue that providing absolute assurance against fraud would make audits prohibitively expensive.</br></br>Although the SEC requires public corporations to have their financial statements audited, it is a mistake to think that audits occur only by government mandate or that audits have no economic value. In 1926, prior to any government requirements, 79% of the corporations listed on the NYSE published audited financial statements. They did so because investors and creditors demanded an auditor's assurance before entrusting the corporations with their money. Today, hundreds of not-for-profit organizations and private businesses voluntarily hire auditors. Research shows that private businesses with audited financial statements pay lower interest rates on their commercial bank loans than do similar private businesses whose financial statements are not audited. Evidently, lenders value the assurance provided by an auditor's report.</br></br>Thousands of CPAs employed in small accounting firms are proud to provide audit services to their clients. Unfortunately, many in the \"Big 5\" appear to share Mr. Jenkins's view that audits are unnecessary compliance exercises. The large firms seem ashamed of their accounting heritage and now call themselves \"professional service organizations.\" The problem is not that audits have no value. The problem is that too many large firm partners are more concerned about making money than with upholding professional standards.</br></br>Paul M.

            "TEXT --->  NEW YORK -- This is a recovery that may need all the help it can muster. The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.</br></br>Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.</br></br>Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.</br></br>This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.</br></br>Further substantial increases seem probable. Most forecasters look for the recovery to persist and broaden in coming months. In the process, businesses will need to expand their facilities appreciably. Indeed, the task could become urgent if the recovery should prove unexpectedly brisk. After much restructuring and many plant closings, manufacturers already are using nearly 80% of their capacity.\n",

            "TEXT --->  NEW YORK -- There may be more good inflation news this week, but it could reflect the price and profit pressures of a weakening economy.</br></br>The November consumer price index, due out tomorrow, is expected to rise only modestly on the heels of last week's report of a drop in the producer price index. Some economists believe that's the silver lining to a darkening manufacturing sector. Further evidence will come from the revised report on third-quarter real gross national product, due Wednesday; November housing starts and permits, due out tomorrow; personal income and consumption, due out Thursday; and durable goods orders on Friday.</br></br>\"These reports don't indicate in any sense that the economy is going to be able to hold its own,\" said Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corp. He says the Federal Reserve Board will \"eventually move to shore up the economy\" by again easing credit.</br></br>Mr. Soss said that lately, \"any good economic news has a `spoiler' built into it.\" Often, he said, the \"bad\" news is in the form of revisions of earlier months' data -- as in the recent November retail sales report, released along with revisions of the two previous months' figures that \"took the steam out\" of the November report.</br></br>One obvious place to look for revision is in the government's second look at third-quarter GNP growth. Although the consensus view calls for the figure to be unchanged at 2.7%, economists point out that there is still one more revision to come. Some analysts, including Gary Ciminero of Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I., say negative readings on GNP will be staved off until the fourth-quarter tally.\n",

            "TEXT --->  WITH THE Senate scheduled to take up the budget this week, now is a good time for liberals to wake up to a truth they've been trying to avoid: Taking a lead role in the crucial budget wars is the only way for Democrats to protect the programs and achieve the broader economic goals they claim to revere.</br></br>The budget philosophy outlined by the Republicans in their first 100 days -- which cuts the safety net under the poor in order to fund tax breaks for the rich -- gives Democrats the perfect opening to offer up an alternative vision that could return them to a majority in the next election. Resorting to simple demagogy in response to the Republican plan will give conservatives precisely the excuse they need to drop the ax on poor people who don't vote for them anyway.</br></br>Take it from a bleeding-heart deficit hawk who left the Clinton administration in despair: The current budget outlook leaves liberals only two choices. They can pray that soaring entitlements, deficits and interest payments somehow won't affect this nation's future, and focus instead on funding other programs that appear to help people directly. Or they can recognize that the costs associated with the retirement of baby boomers combined with our low savings and investment rates mean that old liberal doctrines on entitlements and deficits must now be rethought to achieve lasting liberal goals.</br></br>The Clinton administration thus far can be considered a case study of the first option and why it can't work. Recall that the president came into office rightly pledging to reverse two deficits that threatened our economy: the budget deficit and the public investment deficit. The budget deficit hurts future living standards by soaking up half of our national savings -- that pool of capital comprised of what all of us save as individuals plus what businesses put aside as well.</br></br>When government runs deficits, it borrows from this savings pool to pay for current spending programs, everything from social security checks to FBI salaries. This reduces the savings otherwise available for business investment that's essential for raising our productivity and income. The public investment deficit, meanwhile, refers to the dwindling resources being devoted to what essentially are investments in our long-term future, such things as basic research, roads and bridges and improved education for disadvantaged kids.\n",

Together, the moves prompted banks to cut their prime lending rates to 7.5% from 8%. Other interest rates are likely to fall as well.</br></br>The action followed a meeting Tuesday of the Fed's policy committee, during which officials talked at length about the pessimism that has gripped the U.S. economy, according to some who attended. They noted the sharp drop in consumer confidence in October, as well as the sour attitude of many business executives, including those who sit on the boards of the 12 district Federal Reserve Banks.</br></br>In response to that crisis of confidence, Fed officials decided to take more dramatic action than usual, to give a psychological kick to the economy. The effect was amplified by the fact that it came just one week after the central bank's previous credit-easing move, when it cut the federal funds rate to 5% from 5.25%.</br></br>The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge on loans to each other, and broadly influences other shortterm interest rates. The discount rate is the rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions, and is important largely for its symbolic value.\n",

I have never known Panama without the Americans being here.\"</br></br>Judging from numerous interviews, many Panamanians share his concern about the departure of the Americans, whose presence in Panama dates to its creation in 1903 after it broke from Colombia. In particular, they fear that entrenched political corruption and incompetence in the government will affect the administration and financial stability of the canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They also worry about the economic costs of the U.S. troop pullout as well as potential harm to the investment climate.</br></br>Such reservations are not without irony. The treaties that set the stage for the canal handover and troop withdrawal were negotiated by Panama's then-leader, Gen. Omar Torrijos, and President Jimmy Carter and approved overwhelmingly by Panamanian voters in 1977. The signing of the accords was seen as a powerful assertion of national sovereignty and catapulted Torrijos to the status of national hero.</br></br>In recent years, however, newspaper polls have indicated that between 50 and 70 percent of Panamanians queried support a continued U.S. military presence beyond 2000, particularly when the issue is framed in economic terms. About 36 percent of Panama's 2.8 million people live in poverty, and unemployment hovers near 13 percent. Some polls have even found that a majority of Panamanians would like the United States to retain control of the 50-mile-long canal, or, at least, operate it in partnership with Panama similar to the current arrangement.\n",

            "TEXT --->  In your Dec. 27 editorial \"Flacking for Rubinomics\" you misinterpreted the nature, analysis and conclusions of our research paper on \"The Economic Effects of Fiscal Discipline.\"</br></br>The main point of our paper is that standard economic reasoning, present in almost all macroeconomic textbooks, implies that budget deficits reduce national saving and therefore reduce the future income and living standards of American households. For example, under conservative assumptions and a methodology developed by Harvard professor Greg Mankiw, we show that the $5 trillion decline in projected 10-year surpluses over the past two years translates roughly into a reduction in future income of $1,500 per household per year. That is the real cost of a lack of fiscal discipline.</br></br>These costs occur regardless of whether budget deficits raise interest rates, which reduces Americans' domestic investment, or cause a capital inflow, which reduces Americans' net investment overseas. Therefore, the debate about deficits and interest rates is a bit of a red herring.</br></br>Nonetheless, recent evidence supports the view that deficits affect interest rates. This evidence comes from almost all major macro-econometric models, almost all studies done since 1990, and in particular from studies that properly focus on the relation between interest rates and expected future deficits (rather than current deficits). These facts were somehow omitted in your editorial.</br></br>Contrary to the what you wrote, we emphasize the distinction between the deficit itself and the policies that create the deficit. Thus, for example, the 2001 tax cut had positive effects on economic growth from cutting marginal tax rates, but negative effects due to the increase in the deficit. On balance, all of the existing studies show that the negative effects largely offset and may even outweigh the positive effects. As a result, the net effect of the tax cut on growth is likely to be small and could be negative.\n",

            "TEXT --->  WASHINGTON -- Continued weak exports and strong imports caused the U.S. trade deficit to widen to a record level in August.</br></br>The Commerce Department reported that the trade gap ballooned to $16.77 billion from a seasonally adjusted $14.55 billion in July. The August total was the largest since the department began keeping the numbers in the current format in 1992, and a department analyst estimated that it was probably the biggest since December 1985. Exports in August slipped to an adjusted $74.84 billion from $75.10 billion in July; it was the lowest figure since the $73.43 billion in shipments in January 1997.</br></br>Meanwhile, a growing number of countries continue to ship goods here to try to sell their way out of recession. Imports in August climbed to an adjusted $91.61 billion from $89.65 billion the previous month. Exports were weak across the board, reflecting the spreading economic crisis. The U.S. deficit with Japan, which is mired in recession, swelled to $5.2 billion in August from $4.54 billion a year earlier. The year-over-year comparisons provide the most accurate measurement, since these figures aren't seasonally adjusted.</br></br>The overall trade deficit with Pacific Rim countries, including Japan, surged to $15.69 billion from $11.65 billion a year earlier. The U.S. trade surplus with Brazil narrowed to $363 million from $535 million a year earlier.</br></br>The trade deficit with China, which hasn't been as affected by the Asian economic ills as most of its neighbors, also expanded in August.

            "TEXT --->  Many economists and economic scribes have arrived at a particular gloomy paradigm to describe the current U.S. economy. This consensus is surprising because the paradigm itself is seriously flawed.</br></br>The paradigm consists of four propositions: First, government deficits are responsible for high interest rates; second, high interest rates are responsible for the \"overvalued\" dollar; third, the overvalued dollar is responsible for the huge increase in the U.S. trade deficit; and, finally, the trade deficit is just plain bad.</br></br>The validity of the propositions is limited and decreases rapidly as one moves down the list.</br></br>Consider the first proposition. As Treasury Secretary Donald Regan keeps reminding us, empirical analysis shows no statistically significant historical relationship between budget deficits and interest rates. Over the past three years, while the deficit has more than tripled, the prime rate -- the base interest rate that commercial banks charge on loans to their biggest borrowers with the best credit ratings -- has fallen to 11% from 18.9%. Adjusting interest rates for inflation to approximate the \"real\" rate of interest doesn't change the picture very much: During the same period the real rate fell to 7% from 10%, notwithstanding the tripled deficit.</br></br>Nevertheless, there is common-sense validity to the notion that larger government borrowing will, other things being equal, exert upward pressure on rates. (However, one point that's usually neglected by those who advance this argument is that efforts to reduce the deficit by increasing taxes may also exert upward pressure on interest rates because increased taxes will result in decreased private savings, rather than simply in reduced private spending.)\n",

But underlying data -- on consumer spending, business investment and construction -- paint a picture of a deteriorating economy, one that expanded only because of a rise in exports and a buildup of inventories.</br></br>Excluding inventories, GDP shrank at a 0.2% pace, the first contraction in more than 16 years. Excluding inventories and exports, the economy contracted at a 0.4% rate after increasing 1.3% in the fourth quarter.</br></br>\"It would be a grave mistake to interpret [the GDP] number as even suggesting the economic and financial crisis is over,\" said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group LLC. \"Clearly, this economy will remain in a recessionary environment for the rest of the year.\"</br></br>Many economists said the economy is likely to contract this quarter. Morgan Stanley economists predict GDP will decline 2%.

            "TEXT --->  Ending a turf battle that has lasted nearly two decades, financial market regulators yesterday reached an agreement that clears the way for investors to buy futures contracts based on single stocks.</br></br>The agreement still faces scrutiny from Congress. But lawmakers have told the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission that if they could settle their dispute, Congress would likely adopt their approach. The deal, in which the two have essentially agreed to share regulatory oversight, paves the way to end an 18-year ban on single-stock futures.</br></br>A futures contract is a promise to deliver or to buy at a set date in the future and at a set price a certain item--pounds of coffee, barrels of oil, or, in this case, stocks or bonds. By law, a futures contract must be traded on an exchange.</br></br>Once the ban on single-stock futures is lifted, investors could, for example, sell a futures contract based on shares of International Business Machines Corp. to hedge against a decline in the price of the company's stock, or buy such a contract instead of buying the actual IBM shares.</br></br>Single-stock futures could lower investors' risk by allowing them to hedge against price changes in stocks and bonds. But because they also carry lower margin requirements, similar to those on options contracts, many experts say they could be riskier for many consumers. Initially institutional investors and businesses are expected to be the biggest customers for these new products.\n",

            "TEXT --->  The Japanese yen registered sharp gains Friday during a session in which activity in the dollar and many other currencies featured narrow ranges and little departure from the previous day's levels.</br></br>The catalyst for the yen's surge was comments from Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who said in a Thursday evening meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner that he opposed intentionally devaluing the yen or any other currency. Japan's currency cracked the psychologically important 90 yen barrier against the dollar, hitting to its highest intraday levels in more than seven months on the greenback.</br></br>The new Japanese finance minister's reluctance to control currency levels was taken as a strong suggestion that Tokyo wouldn't intervene even if the dollar sustains its fall below the 90 yen level, said Eisuke Sakakibara, a former top official at Japan's Finance Ministry.</br></br>Before recovering modestly, the dollar fell as far as 89.51 yen, its lowest level since early February. The yen also chalked up solid gains against other currencies, including the euro.</br></br>Late Friday in New York, the yen was trading at 89.85 yen from 91.22 yen a day earlier, while the euro fell to 131.81 yen from 133.69 yen. The euro against the dollar was at $1.4670 from $1.4656 late Thursday, and the U.K. pound was at $1.5930 from $1.6064. The dollar was at 1.0293 Swiss francs from 1.0300 francs.\n",

So it's worth noting the explanations they are offering for the miserable economic growth numbers released on Friday. They blame acts of nature and Republicans.</br></br>Gene Sperling, who must have drawn the short White House straw, was asked on Fox News yesterday about the less than 1% GDP growth in the first half of 2011. The head of the White House National Economic Council blamed \"things outside of our control,\" adding that \"We have had headwinds that have hurt this economy--higher oil prices, supply chain-disruptions from the historic earthquake in Japan.\"</br></br>We'll concede the earthquake point, though that should only be a temporary hit and should contribute to faster growth for the rest of the year. As for high oil prices, they are not an act of God. The oil and general commodity boom is in part a result of the expansionary Federal Reserve monetary policy that the Obama Administration has fully supported.</br></br>Then came the real hoot. The big problem, Mr. Sperling said, is \"the cloud of uncertainty that comes from the American public thinking that we are on the verge of default. And that has hurt confidence and hurt our economy over the last few months. No question.\"</br></br>Brett Baier of Fox interjected: \"Wait a second. So you're tying all of this negative to the debt-ceiling debate?\" Mr. Sperling replied: \"No, I'm not tying all of it,\" whereupon he took another spin around earthquakes and oil prices before reiterating that \"When we allow the uncertainty created by whether our country is going to go to default, to create uncertainty for investors, for job creators, that's a self-inflicted wound.\"\n",

            "TEXT --->  WASHINGTON -- Hoping to lure private capital back to emerging markets, the World Bank plans to provide guarantees to help poor countries sell bonds to international investors.</br></br>The bank's board is expected on Tuesday to approve the new policy, which could last as long as two years. The partial guarantees, limited initially to a total of $2 billion, are intended to restore investor confidence in governments that adhere to sound economic policies but whose ability to borrow on international capital markets has been undermined by investor panic. That situation has been a common one during the financial upheaval of the past 20 months.</br></br>The guarantee program, which could also apply to commercial-bank loans, is one component of a broader international effort to prevent and resolve financial crises. The bank, the International Monetary Fund and the rich countries that fund them are trying to make as much progress as possible on those initiatives in time for the World Bank/IMF spring meetings, here at the end of the month.</br></br>A centerpiece of that effort is the search for ways to encourage private investors -- an increasing source of financing for developing countries during the 1990s -- to return to emerging-market bonds and to stay when things get shaky.</br></br>The World Bank and IMF are walking a fine line. They don't want to bail out private investors who already receive high yields on emerging-market bonds because the investors are taking big risks. But the institutions also want to be sure that deserving emerging-market governments have access to private capital even when markets are nervous. World Bank guarantees would make the bonds less risky; in exchange, investors presumably would accept lower interest rates.\n",

            "TEXT --->  In the first three quarters of 1996, Canada's unemployment rate averaged 9.6%, while the U.S. rate was only 5.4%. In fact, every year since 1981, Canada's unemployment rate has exceeded the U.S. rate. The gap averaged 2.1 percentage points between 1981 and 1989, and has risen to an average of 3.8 percentage points in the 1990s.</br></br>This widening gap worries many Canadian politicians and citizens. The highest annual U.S. unemployment rate since 1941 was 9.7% in 1982, during the depths of the 1981-82 recession. But Canada is not in a recession. Although growth is slow, real output between 1989 and 1996 grew an average of 1.5% per year. So why is unemployment so much higher in Canada than in the U.S.?</br></br>One cause, you might suspect, lies in how the Canadian and U.S. governments measure unemployment. In Canada, passive job searchers, those who look for a job only by consulting the want ads, are counted as unemployed. In the U.S., you have to be actively searching to be classified as unemployed. But this definitional difference, according to economist Jay Zagorsky of the Center for Human Resource Research at Ohio State University, can account for only 0.7 percentage points of the 4.2-point difference.</br></br>Also, many U.S. residents who might be counted as unemployed under the Canadian definition are in prison. The much higher U.S. incarceration rate, though, still can account for only about 0.2 percentage points of the 4.2-point gap. Moreover, notes Andrew Sharpe of the Ottawa-based Centre for the Study of Living Standards, if you count as \"half-unemployed\" part-time workers who would rather work full-time, the difference between Canadian and U.S. unemployment rates widens by about 1.5 percentage points.</br></br>An obvious suspect when trying to explain high unemployment is a country's system of unemployment insurance. The more valuable the benefits, the longer they last and the easier they are to qualify for, the greater the unemployment rate, all other things equal. The reason: People have an incentive to stay unemployed and to be very choosy about the jobs they will accept when they are subsidized to stay at home. Canada's unemployment insurance system became much more expensive in 1972 when Pierre Trudeau's government increased the benefits' value and duration, and decreased the period required to qualify.\n",

            "TEXT --->  WASHINGTON -- In a surprise move aimed at silencing a rising chorus of criticism about their financial disclosures, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreed for the first time to submit themselves to scrutiny by federal securities regulators.</br></br>The Securities and Exchange Commission will oversee only the government-sponsored mortgage giants' existing common stock, however, under an agreement reached Friday with the SEC and Treasury. That means the companies have sidestepped -- for now, at least -- their biggest worry: full-scale securities regulation. The deal excludes direct government oversight of the debt and mortgage-backed securities the companies issue on Wall Street.</br></br>Fannie and Freddie will have to submit the periodic financial statements, proxy statements and reports that other issuers file with the SEC. But they already provide similar information to investors, so the immediate practical effect is relatively small.</br></br>Still, in broad terms the agreement with the Bush administration is a milestone for the two companies. Created decades ago as government agencies to increase the efficiency of the U.S. mortgage market, Fannie and Freddie later were privatized. But they maintained many of their ties to the government, including a line of credit to the Treasury and exemption from SEC oversight. The companies are reluctant to give up those benefits because they contribute to a common perception that Fannie and Freddie are backed by the federal government, and therefore worthy of preferred status with investors.</br></br>Some economic policymakers and rivals in the financial-services industry worry that Fannie and Freddie are taking advantage of this implied government backing -- which enables them to borrow more cheaply than their rivals -- to grow too large and crowd out competitors. More recently, critics have warned that the lack of SEC-required disclosure of Fannie's and Freddie's mortgage-backed securities leaves investors in the dark about exactly what they are buying.\n",

Twenty-seven-year-old Trent McKenna, who started last year with the Houston office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld L.L.P. at a base salary of $78,000, has already received raises of about $37,000. \"It's not so much that we're 100% worth whatever salary,\" he says. \"What's driving this is that we're a commodity that is more scarce than it used to be.\"</br></br>The root cause of the salary surge is the booming economy.

The biggest Texas law firms expect to shell out up to $12 million each in extra salaries this year.</br></br>That could have drastic consequences, and not just for the legal profession: In-coming lawyers will be asked to work more hours; partners at top firms may make less money; and big firms could lose clients to cheaper firms or in-house lawyers.

Now, Big Three profits are about to show the strain.</br></br>As General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. slash production, most industry analysts forecast second-quarter profits will at best be even with year-earlier results. The third quarter could see an even steeper earnings slide. GM is expected to cut U.S. car production about 15%, and at least one analyst predicts an operating loss for GM in the period.</br></br>As Detroit slumps, the broader U.S. economy could slump with it. \"If you cut another 150,000 {vehicles} out of U.S. production in the third quarter, you could cut 1% out of the GNP {gross national product},\" says Kidder, Peabody & Co. analyst John V. Kirnan. \"That could tip the economy into a quarter of negative growth. Then all you need is another to have a textbook recession.\"</br></br>If the bears are right, and a recession that pushes car and light truck sales below 14 million vehicles hits next year, each of the Big Three is in better shape to weather the storm than during the 1980-82 recession years. Back then, Chrysler's survival hinged on a federal bailout, Ford lost more than $3 billion in three years, and GM in 1980 recorded its first full-year loss in 60 years.</br></br>But even a mild downturn will put the Big Three to a harsh test. For one thing, Japanese auto makers are gearing up enough U.S. plant capacity to build two million cars a year by 1992, at a time U.S. auto makers already can build two million more cars than they can sell. As the Japanese fight to make their U.S. plants profitable, they will put pressure on the Big Three to hold down prices and accept tighter profit margins.\n",

England tried it, Canada tried it and several U.S. school districts have tried it -- linking teacher pay to test scores has never worked.</br></br>The \"Management 101\" philosophy advanced by Mr. Moe is grounded in assumptions about pay that are misleading and incorrect. Southwest Airlines has never used individual incentives, and it is the cost and productivity leader in its industry. After surveying companies that experimented with different ways to tie pay to individual performance, consulting firm William M. Mercer concluded that \"most individual merit or performance-based pay plans share two attributes: They absorb vast amounts of time and resources, and they make everybody unhappy.\"</br></br>The strongest incentives for teachers and all working people are competitive salaries and good working conditions. Connecticut adopted this view some years ago when its schools were in serious trouble. Today Connecticut consistently ranks above the national average in math and reading, a turnaround made possible by higher salaries for qualified faculty, increased licensing standards and mentoring for all new teachers.</br></br>While Mr. Moe and others are riding on the hope that an end-of-the- year cash bonus will translate into student success, teachers and those who know better will continue working to transform teacher quality at its core.</br></br>Reg Weaver\n",

The seasonally adjusted index uses 1985 as a base of 100. The September index was down 6.7 points from the year-earlier level of 115.7.

The latest economic statistics, showing personal income rising only about half as fast as prices, may well have caused some consumer uneasiness.

Kennedy's administration. He was a major contributor to theories of investment, consumption, money and banking and economic growth, and he was widely known in academia and business as a leading apostle of the economic thinking of British economist John Maynard Keynes: that tax and budget policies can be used effectively to regulate an economy.</br></br>As a Keynesian economist, Dr. Tobin feuded with monetarists who argue that controlling the supply of money and credit is the best way to regulate an economy. His sharp attacks on Milton Friedman, the winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in economics and widely recognized as the dean of monetarists, were particularly well publicized, as were his criticisms in the early 1980s of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker. Volcker's \"single-minded\" effort to curb inflation with tough monetary policy, Dr. Tobin told a congressional subcommittee, was likely to result in damage \"to the real economy in terms of unemployment, low production, recession, low investment and so on.\"</br></br>Economics, Dr. Tobin once told a meeting of the American Economic Association, \"inevitably blends ideology and science.\"</br></br>Describing the portfolio selection theory that helped him win a Nobel Prize, he said it \"sets forth the principle of not putting all your eggs in one basket because then, if something goes wrong, you lose them all at once.\" This theory was said to have been influential in the willingness of investors to diversify holdings.

Alan Weverstad, executive director of environment and energy for GM, told the court that compliance would cost his company $25 billion, and by 2016 it would still be seven miles-per-gallon short of the 43 mpg target, the Detroit News reports. However, an expert for Vermont contended the new rules would add $1,500 to the cost of a vehicle -- far less than the auto makers' estimate of as much as $6,000. Judge William Sessions rejected a host of industry arguments, including that the rules would limit consumer choice, create economic hardship for car makers, increase unemployment, undermine safety, and allow states to usurp federal authority, as the New York Times reports. \"It is improbable,\" he wrote, according to the Times, \"that an industry that prides itself on its modernity, flexibility and innovativeness will be unable to meet the requirements of the regulation, especially with the range of technological possibilities and alternatives currently before it.\"</br></br>Vermont's rules, like those adopted by 12 other states, are a copy of California's, and altogether about a third of the nation's auto market is at issue, The Wall Street Journal reports. \"California has special dispensation under federal law to enact emissions rules that are tougher than the federal government's, a nod to California's record of dirty air,\" the Journal writes, adding that other states can replicate California's standards. As Vermont's effort is an extension of California's, and California is waiting for its latest federal waiver, the Vermont court decision could still be rendered irrelevant. \"Congress has essentially designated California as a proving ground for innovation in emissions control regulations,\" Judge Sessions wrote, according to the Sacramento Bee. \"History suggests that the ingenuity of the (auto) industry, once put in gear, responds admirably to most technological challenges.\" The Detroit Free Press writes that \"the industry's best hope for stopping the rules lies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,\" but the paper notes that the EPA has never turned down California's request for a waiver to enact emissions rules -- and California has said it will sue the EPA if it does.\n",

The revised numbers were based on more complete source data, some of which is estimated in the advance release.</br></br>This latest evidence that the economy is surging ahead pushed up short-term interest rates yesterday.

The Fed raised its target for overnight rates earlier this month by three-fourths of a percentage point, the sixth increase this year.</br></br>However, some analysts said the Fed likely would leave rates unchanged for the next two months as its policy makers wait to see whether this year's rate increases begin to slow economic growth.

Mr. Kerry would use the additional revenue to reduce the overall U.S. corporate tax rate to 33.25% from the current 35%.</br></br>The stick-and-carrot approach would encourage companies to shift more of their investments to the U.S., Mr. Kerry's aides said.</br></br>Mr. Kerry also would offer U.S. companies a one-year tax break to repatriate earnings now held overseas, a pot of money that the Congressional Research Service estimates at around $600 billion.

Kerry aides didn't have an estimate of the amount of revenue they expect would be produced by that gambit.</br></br>But Mr. Kerry is counting on the money to pay for another part of his plan: a two-year, $22 billion employer tax credit that would cover payroll taxes for new employees.

Some big names are backing 3DO's ambition, including Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Time Warner Inc. and AT&T Corp. The company says it has recruited 550 outside game developers and pressed over one million copies of 50 titles on compact disks that hold computer data. It also asserts it got off to a \"strong start\" in Japan, selling 80,000 machines in the first two months.</br></br>But despite a blizzard of publicity generated in part by Mr. Hawkins's marketing skills, the company has been hampered by surprisingly slow initial sales in the U.S. where demanding kid consumers say the games don't offer enough pizazz for the $500 price. Only 40,000 units of its game player, sold under Matsushita's Panasonic label, have been sold since October despite a price cut from an original $700. \"Everyone has been shocked at the lower sales,\" says a person close to the company. Now, after posting a $51.4 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 3DO has about two quarters of cash left amid mounting expenses, such as a national advertising campaign and a shift to in-house game development.</br></br>Mr. Hawkins, who is also chairman of video-game publisher Electronic Arts Inc., has sold nearly $15 million in Electronic Arts stock since November. A person familiar with his plans says he intends to put $10 million into 3DO and raise $10 million from GoldStar Co., a Korean conglomerate, and an additional $10 million from current partners in a private placement of stock by the end of June. The company had attempted to raise money through a secondary offering last December, but its sagging stock price thwarted the plan. Having peaked at $47 in October, the stock closed unchanged at $15.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.</br></br>\"I enjoy putting my money where my mouth is,\" Mr. Hawkins says, but declines to discuss specific plans for his money or identify any next-round investors.

The transaction was valued at about $160 billion when announced, but the decline in AOL's stock reduced the value to a current price of $138 billion.</br></br>In some respects, that was completely expected, and the one-day delay before AOL's decline -- now standing at about 18% -- was largely driven by the early euphoria over the deal. But what also took place was a massive transfer of value from AOL shareholders to Time Warner shareholders, so a decline in AOL was inevitable, points out one media investment banker. Time Warner's shares ended up 25% for the week, a very respectable showing.</br></br>Though it was precedent-setting in many respects, from a financial point of view the transaction was a typical late '90s deal: a fast-growing upstart with a high-multiple stock -- WorldCom Inc., Qwest Communications International Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. -- using its currency to buy a more-established company with hard assets. Thus, WorldCom acquired MCI Communications to form MCI WorldCom Inc. (and is now buying Sprint Corp.), Qwest is acquiring U S West Inc., and Global Crossing acquired Frontier Corp.

            "TEXT --->  The near-collapse of a huge and unregulated investment fund this week has prompted lawmakers to consider whether closer regulatory scrutiny is necessary to track the complex -- and often obscure -- financial deals these funds make with large sums of borrowed money.</br></br>\"We are exploring . . . whether these funds that can pose a threat to the economic system or to the bank deposit insurance system should have more federal oversight,\" said Richard Baker, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the House Banking Committee's subcommittee on capital markets and securities.</br></br>Wednesday, at the urging of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a group of 14 banks and securities firms agreed to provide more than $3.5 billion to rescue Greenwich, Conn.-based Long-Term Capital Management L.P. after fears rose that its demise would send a shock wave through the global economy. The once highflying fund faced losses on about $100 billion in bets it had made in financial markets around the world. Baker and the staff of other lawmakers suggested that the question of regulating this type of funds, known as hedge funds, could affect the progress of pending legislation to revamp 65-year-old banking and securities laws.</br></br>Unlike most other financial companies, operators of hedge funds answer to no oversight institution, either state or federal, even though the funds make speculative, multibillion-dollar bets with borrowed money in markets all over the world. As recently as last week, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said he had no problem with that arrangement.</br></br>\"Hedge funds are very strongly regulated by those who lend the money,\" Greenspan said in response to a question by Baker during testimony before the House Banking Committee. \"The major vehicle for supervision of lending is really from those who make the loans.\"\n",

A similar fate could be in store for areas of the country that faced the deepest housing and employment shocks in the latest downturn, the report warned.</br></br>\"This is a structural change,\" said Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, referring to the latest recession. \"The economy is just not going to come back the way it has before.\"</br></br>To avoid repeating the scenario that followed the 1980s downturn, papers commissioned by the Hamilton Project -- formed by some Clinton administration Democrats to devise policies to improve the economy -- recommended revitalization efforts targeting the worst-off communities.</br></br>Among the proposals: a government-sponsored bank that would provide loans of up to $10,000 for people who have been laid off in the past five years and are looking to move.

With lower interest rates, student borrowers could save thousands of dollars over the life of their loans.</br></br>White House officials raised the idea of ending the government- subsidized consolidations as part of a supplementary spending bill for the current fiscal year being developed by the House Appropriations Committee.</br></br>The proposal is one of three preliminary suggestions forwarded by the White House to deal with a $1.3 billion shortfall in the Pell Grant program for low-income students.

In the 1980s, I witnessed firsthand the Texas real-estate bubble and covered companies crushed in the junk-bond bubble. I wrote a book about the crash of 1929. And to my terrific shame, at the top of an inflated market, I once paid $50 for a $5 Beanie Baby named Peace.</br></br>In studying what drives bubbles, I've come to believe that they follow fairly regular patterns.

            "TEXT --->  Beating down the dollar has become a popular sport lately. But the greenback may be about to get off the mat.</br></br>The dollar's decline this year has been unrelenting. It has fallen 5% against the pound, 7% against the yen, 10% against the euro and 14% against the Canadian dollar. Against the Federal Reserve's trade- weighted basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped 8%.</br></br>For years, most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen. To finance its huge trade deficit, the U.S. has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world. The thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever-greater quantities of dollar-based assets. When they'd had enough, the dollar would fall.</br></br>And so it has. Many economists think the dollar will weaken further. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University calculated in 2005 that with the broadest measure of the U.S. trade deficit -- the current account -- running at more than 6% of the nation's economic output, the dollar needed to fall as much as 30% against the Fed's currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for Americans, shrinking the trade gap, as has been happening lately.)</br></br>By that reckoning, the dollar needs to drop an additional 20%. And the Fed's new openness to cutting interest rates, if the textbooks are right, should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns.\n",

I was feeling guilty about the fact that the occasion had passed without comment, here or almost anyplace else, until I put in a call to Jerry Ford last week.</br></br>\"Betty and I decided to downplay it ourselves,\" he said. \"We had a quiet dinner with some friends here at Beaver Creek {Colo.} and agreed we'd have a bigger gathering when we reach the 25th.\"</br></br>That low-keyed approach is typical of Ford, who has never been much for fuss and ceremony. But, as I mentioned to him, part of my vacation reading was a book published earlier this year, \"Time and Chance: Gerald Ford's Appointment with History.\" Written by James Cannon, a longtime Newsweek reporter and editor who later worked on the staffs of Ford, Nelson Rockefeller and Howard H. Baker Jr., it is a vivid reminder of the critical role the quiet man from Grand Rapids, Mich., played in the greatest constitutional crisis this Republic has faced since the Civil War.</br></br>\"Now,\" Ford said on the phone, \"people in their twenties have no recollection of it at all. They have no way to recognize the trauma of Watergate, the Vietnam War. Those were major crises. Jim's book brings out the tension that was in the atmosphere.\"</br></br>Tension does not begin to describe it. In the space of 10 months, from October of 1973 to August of 1974, these things happened: The vice president of the United States, Spiro T. Agnew, was forced to resign rather than face criminal charges of accepting payoffs for political favors; a new vice president, Ford, was selected by Nixon (after Nixon was persuaded that his first choice, John B. Connally, was not politically viable) and, in a never-before-utilized procedure, Ford went through confirmation hearings in both the House and Senate and was confirmed by overwhelming votes of both bodies.\n",

Moreover, the higher ticket sales and attendance figures were due to the proliferation of expensively promoted \"franchise\" movies and sequels, masking what otherwise would have been a bleak year for most studios.</br></br>The estimated 11% increase in ticket sales comes from Exhibitor Relations Co., a closely held firm that analyzes and distributes box-office data it receives from the studios.</br></br>The explosion in sales of digital videodiscs during 2002 will help mitigate any miscalculations the studios made in coming up with more original movies. DVD sales increased 50% to $8.1 billion in 2002, according to Adams Media Research, as consumers showed a willingness to buy low-price discs at mass retailers rather than rent movies. With the new format gaining favor, sales of VHS format videos, which peaked in 1996 at $6 billion, fell to $4.3 billion.</br></br>The rise in ticket sales and attendance also was helped by theater operators increasingly packing 15-plus-screen cinemas with multiple showings of the same movie on opening weekend.

Figures Monday are expected to show sales of existing homes fell nearly 4% in February from January. On Tuesday, the government's index of home prices is forecast to register its seventh drop in eight months. And on Wednesday, economists anticipate new home sales in February will post a monthly increase of about 2% monthly increase, which will do little to dent January's nearly 13% decline.</br></br>Partly because of this, the rental market is heating up. Average U.S. apartment vacancy rates dropped to 6.6% last year from 8%, according to property-research firm Reis, while rents rose 2.3%. This has developers salivating over the potential for a multiyear rental boom. After all, the glut of foreclosed, single-family homes so far isn't proving much competition. Occupied apartments rose by about 58,000 in the fourth quarter, the biggest increase for that period in 10 years, according to Reis.</br></br>It is \"very good to be in the apartment business today,\" David Neithercut, chief executive of Equity Residential, the biggest public U.S. real-estate investment trust, remarked at a recent conference. Population growth, a gradual firming of the labor market and a drop in the U.S. homeownership rate to 65% from its near-70% peak could generate about 4.5 million new renter households over the next five years, according to Greenstreet Advisors.\n",

            "TEXT --->  In the spring of 1923, a sick and frustrated Lenin penned an article for Pravda titled \"Better Fewer, But Better.\" The state he had willed into existence was mass-producing communists who knew nothing of communism. Better that the state should take its time, Lenin counseled, and turn out fewer but higher-quality commissars.</br></br>In fact, the genius of the Soviet system was precisely its capacity to mass-produce thugs. One system that has taken Lenin's words to heart, however, is American manufacturing. Each year, our factories employ a smaller and smaller share of American workers, but each year the value of their output continues to rise.</br></br>The dollar value of American-made goods today is three times what it was in the mid-1950s, The Post's Peter S. Goodman reported on Labor Day. Conversely, the percentage of American workers employed in manufacturing is a little less than a third of the level at mid-century: 10 percent today, 34 percent in 1950. Employers have outsourced such labor-intensive industries as clothing and textiles, retaining the manufacture of high-value products for their domestic factories.</br></br>America builds ever-more-innovative products, but ever-fewer Americans share in that bounty. We generate millions of jobs in lower-paying service-sector work even as the number of manufacturing workers continues to shrink (19 million in 1979, 14 million today). Nor do manufacturing jobs, immersed in the cauldron of global competition, offer anything near the security and middle-class living standards that many of them used to. With millions of digitizable service-sector jobs (many requiring college educations) subject to global competition as well, it's no wonder that the income of the typical American household has been flat even as national productivity rates continue to rise.</br></br>Rebuilding mass prosperity in America will require two epochal shifts in the way our nation does business. First, non-manufacturing jobs not subject to global competition -- in transportation, construction, health care, sales -- must be upgraded and upskilled the way many of their counterparts in manufacturing have. Second, the workers in those jobs must regain the power to bargain for decent wages, a power that's eroded as the union movement has shrunk from representing close to 40 percent of private-sector workers in mid-century to just 7 percent today.\n",

            "TEXT --->  WASHINGTON -- Reaffirming its landmark 1976 campaign-finance decision, the Supreme Court ruled that states may impose limits on campaign contributions to candidates for statewide office.</br></br>In a 6-3 decision, the justices said a Missouri law that capped contributions to statewide candidates at different levels, with an inflation adjustment, didn't violate free-speech rights. The law was challenged in 1998 by a small political-action group, Shrink Missouri Government PAC. The law was upheld by a U.S. district court in Missouri but overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis.</br></br>The decision was announced yesterday, as Iowans prepared to vote in their state's caucuses in the kickoff of the 2000 campaign season. The timing highlighted the growing public disgust with the huge amount of money needed to mount a campaign and the amount of influence -- and sometimes corruption -- that such contributions often bring.</br></br>As a result, both advocates and critics of campaign-finance laws had been interested in whether the high court would use the Missouri case to redraw the landscape created by its 1976 decision, Buckley vs. Valeo. At that time, the justices ruled that the Constitution permitted limits on campaign contributions but not on campaign spending. The current limit on contributions by individuals in federal elections is $1,000, slightly below the upper limit of $1,075 in the Missouri case.</br></br>Writing for the majority, Justice David Souter addressed the corruption issue, which was the prime justification for the Missouri law. \"There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption on our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.\"\n",

Enrolling federally-insured patients in a simple but aggressive program to control the disease would cost the government $1,024 per person per year -- money that largely would be recovered after 25 years through lower spending on dialysis, kidney transplants, amputations and other forms of treatment, the study found.</br></br>However, except for the youngest diabetics, the additional services would add to overall health spending, not decrease it, the study shows.</br></br>\"There's no free lunch here.

Though the Washington area has attracted immigrants with family connections, jobs associated with government contracting, the high-tech sector and rapid residential expansion have also drawn people, Frey said.</br></br>The Census numbers include both immigrants and native-born members of various ethnic groups. The Indian population, which has increased by 50 percent in the past five years, has the highest median income of any group, at $87,369.

But a closer look at the evidence presents a very different picture.</br></br>The U.S. is indeed running record trade and current-account deficits. This is associated with a record flow of capital to the U.S. from abroad, much of it from Asia. True, the most recent data from the U.S. showed that foreigners reduced their net purchases of long-term securities to $56.4 billion in May, down 26% from April's figure -- the lowest monthly total in seven months. But net purchases in May were weak only in comparison to their strength in the previous six months. Foreigners heavily increased their long-term commitment to the U.S. in late 2003 and early 2004, while lightening up in May.</br></br>---</br></br>What those hitting the panic button fail to mention is that the excess of net long-term foreign financing over the current-account deficit had reached an all-time record $302 billion in the 12 months through April (the widest point on the graph nearby). Because longer- term debt went up by more than the current account deficit, the effect was to lengthen the maturity of the U.S. external financing, adding to its stability. The strength of the dollar in recent weeks in the face of concerns, probably temporary, about a U.S. slowdown should help undercut the handwringing over the lower level of purchases in May.</br></br>The Big Questions are whether U.S. expansion is dependent on Asia's savings or at risk due to the trade imbalance. The answer to both is no. The expansion is driven primarily by domestic developments: the increasing flexibility of the economy and improvements since 2001 in the value of the dollar, interest rates and tax rates. America is in the early stages of a relatively long expansion, in which inflation and innovation will be more important variables than the trade deficit or foreign-capital flows.\n",

This argument might have it exactly backward. Indeed, history shows that cutting spending in order to reduce deficits may be the key to promoting economic recovery.</br></br>In Europe today, the risk of a renewed recession comes not from the spending cuts that some governments have enacted, but from a sovereign debt overhang and multiple bank failures. July's stress tests were not reassuring because they didn't test the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt; had they done so, many banks would have failed. Those banks remain a threat to the European economy.</br></br>In the U.S., meanwhile, recent stimulus packages have proven that the \"multiplier\" -- the effect on GDP per one dollar of increased government spending -- is small. Stimulus spending also means that tax increases are coming in the future; such increases will further threaten economic growth.</br></br>Economic history shows that even large adjustments in fiscal policy, if based on well-targeted spending cuts, have often led to expansions, not recessions. Fiscal adjustments based on higher taxes, on the other hand, have generally been recessionary.</br></br>My colleague Silvia Ardagna and I recently co-authored a paper examining this pattern, as have many studies over the past 20 years.

That's what it's coming to in Japan, where even sober analysts are starting to bet on a government takeover of the country's troubled banks.</br></br>It's also what happens when a country prefers to sweep its problems under the rug for a decade or so. By now there could be as much as $1.5 trillion in bad loans at Japan's banks, an additional $1 trillion in insurance companies and a similar amount in the postal saving system.</br></br>That's \"a total of $3 trillion to $4 trillion of loans that are uncollectible or troubled,\" says Japan-watcher Anthony Miller, writing in The Asian Wall Street Journal this week, \"or between 75% and 100% of Japanese GDP.\" America's S&L crisis, which involved an amount equivalent to less than 5% of U.S. GDP, pales in contrast.</br></br>But the difference is that the U.S. faced the S&L problem squarely, albeit with the usual political messiness. Some careers were ruined (Fernand St Germain), and some people went to jail (Charlie Keating), but the failures were liquidated, depositors were paid off and the market found a bottom. In Japan, by contrast, the system hasn't enforced any accountability and so the banks have been allowed to roam the landscape like financial zombies.</br></br>Tokyo's stock market is signaling that crunch time may now finally be approaching for several of these walking dead. The share price of UFJ Holdings, Japan's fourth-biggest bank by assets, is down 50% this month. Mizuho Holdings, the world's biggest bank, is down 40%.

So Osborn, a venture capitalist, set out to beat them at their own game by pumping more than $50,000 into the campaigns to support eight slow-growth candidates for the county board of supervisors in 1999. They all won.</br></br>Stunned by the defeat, pro-development interests in the Washington suburb have vowed to unseat the new board, which has sliced more than 80,000 houses from county plans. \"If you are a major player in a billion-dollar industry, are you going to let your industry evaporate?\" asked Bryan Brooks, a local developer. The developers' response? Up the ante.</br></br>That's no small threat in Virginia, known nationally as the Wild West of campaign finance. There are no contribution limits for state or local offices here, making anything possible. \"If you want to give $6 billion to some guy who's running for sheriff or local delegate, you can do it,\" says Steve Calos, executive director of the Richmond-based Center for Open, Ethical and Accountable Government.</br></br>Big money goes small town? You betcha. Americans are used to thinking of national politics as the place where the big decisions get made -- and where the big money gets spent. That premise drove the campaign finance reform legislation President Bush signed last month. But that ballyhooed legislation did nothing to stem the flow of money to local and state campaigns. Local politics are just as fortified -- some say corrupted -- by cash as federal ones, and often more so. From the Blue Ridge mountain foothills of Loudoun to Laguna Hills, Calif., the excesses of K Street are flourishing on the Main Streets that lead to the nation's state houses, city halls and county buildings.</br></br>The most intimate arena of our democracy can also be the easiest to manipulate. A little money can go a long way in local contests. The rules are looser, and fewer people are watching to see if those rules are followed. Voter turnout is often lower, giving one-issue champions and special interest groups greater influence. As on Capitol Hill, contributions often make great investments. \"People don't give money to honor America or show their love of democracy. They are buying something,\" says Calos. \"Money buys results.\"\n",

But they wound up in a dispute with their insurance company and had to turn to an unexpected lender: the U.S. Small Business Administration.</br></br>Best known for guaranteeing small-business loans and offering advice to entrepreneurs, the SBA is sharply increasing its lending to homeowners, such as the Kligers, through its Office of Disaster Assistance. Today, the home-loan portion of the SBA's disaster-loan portfolio exceeds $3.14 billion, more than double its level three years ago. In contrast, the business loans in the portfolio total $3.45 billion, a 47% increase in three years.</br></br>SBA officials attribute the explosion in home lending to Mother Nature. Since 1993, disasters such as the Northridge earthquake, floods in the Middle West and Hurricane Andrew in Florida have created an unprecedented, concentrated demand for the low-interest loans administered by the SBA. (The interest rates are about 4% annually for business owners and individual borrowers.)</br></br>In many of the latest disasters, homeowners and renters were hit disproportionately hard, prompting huge waves of lending to individual borrowers, says Bernard Kulik, an SBA associate administrator who oversees the disaster office. After Hurricane Andrew swept through Florida in 1992, nearly 16,000 homeowners and renters there borrowed a total of $252.7 million. Businesses in the state borrowed $217.2 million. One reason for the high homeowner use: \"I would say that businesses pay more attention to insurance than homeowners do,\" Mr. Kulik says.</br></br>Officials at the agency stress that the loan program isn't a giveaway: It estimates that 35% to 45% of all loan applicants are rejected because of credit problems, failure to provide sufficient information or other reasons. Homeowners generally can borrow no more than $200,000 to restore their homes to original condition. In addition, homeowners and renters can qualify for as much as $40,000 to replace personal property.\n",

Consider this arithmetic:</br></br>Last year businesses other than farms increased their workers' compensation 4.2 percent while raising the prices they charged only 0.7 percent. The companies could do that without clobbering their profits because productivity gains offset 2.2 percentage points of that difference.

The firms eked out a small increase in profit on each unit sold, workers' real pay went up 2.6 percent faster than consumer prices, and inflation went down. (The Labor Department uses the consumer price index, which rose 1.6 percent last year, to adjust compensation for inflation.)</br></br>However, many analysts and policymakers are questioning whether such good news is likely to continue for long.\n",

Still, we thought it worth reviewing our report of their stock selections to see which worked out and which didn't.</br></br>Peter Lynch, who runs the Magellan Fund for Fidelity Management & Research in Boston, scored huge gains on six out of eight stocks he named.

But his selections did much better than average, showing that stock picking is an art even in a bull market.</br></br>Mr. Lynch staked his money on little-known thrifts that had recently converted to stock ownership from operating as depositor-owned institutions. \"It wasn't just an interest rate bet,\" he says. \"I thought they would do better because the managers were now owners\" of shares in a publicly traded company. \"You had capitalism on your side,\" the money manager says.\n",

JDS just completed the purchase of E-Tek Dynamics Inc. for $15 billion on June 30, and began discussions with SDL almost the day that the E-Tek deal closed, according to Jozef Straus, JDS Uniphase's co-chairman and chief executive officer. Donald Scifres, SDL's chief executive, will become co-chairman of the board with Mr. Straus and a board member of JDS Uniphase. Marty Kaplan remains chairman of JDS, and Mr. Straus will remain chief executive.</br></br>The transaction values SDL's shares at $441.5125 a share, compared with Friday's closing stock price of $295.3125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Each share of SDL will be exchanged for 3.8 shares of JDS Uniphase. Shares of SDL were up $10.875, and climbed last week on some takeover speculation, as well as on expectations of strong financial performance.</br></br>One reason why the price tag is so high is that Corning Inc., a rival fiber-optics concern, had been bidding for the San Jose, Calif.-based company as well, said one person familiar with the matter.</br></br>The deal shows how major manufacturers are moving rapidly to team up so they can add capacity and develop higher-performing products to keep up with surging demand for fiber-optic equipment.

After opening the year in a pessimistic mood, investors turned joyous as the Dow Jones Industrial Average charged through the 4000 and 5000 milestones before the end of the year.</br></br>By year end, most every investor had reason to smile. The Dow, up 33.45%, edged out most of the mutual funds, but even those laggards had a good year. And all these gains came with little queasiness. According to Ned Davis Research Inc., Nokomis, Fla., the Dow's biggest correction in 1995 was a record low 3.3%. In addition, Ned Davis Research says the Dow, which hit its last bear market bottom in October 1990, has put in its longest run ever without a 10% correction.</br></br>But the spectacular year required something akin to a razor's edge dance by the economy. The enriching combination of modest growth with good profits -- the so-called soft landing -- came about despite a great deal of cynicism that it could ever happen.</br></br>Can that perfect combination continue? Most analysts now say yes. Sort of. Few expect another raucous year with gains of more than 30%. Instead, the bull market will have a return to normalcy, with consensus expectations hovering around a 10% return for the year.</br></br>Of course, it must be noted early on that many chin-scratchers erred badly in their 1995 outlooks a year ago.

I strongly disagree.</br></br>Before taking any action on economic or military aid to the Philippines, the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, which I chair, held several hearings with prominent, independent experts. There was a consensus among them that the severe economic crisis confronting the Philippines is potentially far more dangerous in the short run than the long-term threat posed by the Communist-dominated New People's Army. Unless this economic challenge is effectively addressed, the possibility of an economic collapse cannot be precluded. Under such circumstances, the ensuing chaos would certainly lead to political instability, and play directly into the hands of the Communist insurgents, whose ranks would be appreciably swelled by the victims of the collapse.</br></br>The growth of the NPA in recent years has been a function primarily of the deterioration in the economy. Most knowledgeable observers agree that, at the margin, the Philippine Government can more effectively counter the spread of Communism with additional economic aid to deal with economic problems rather than with additional military aid, which is unlikely to be used by the corrupt and brutal military establishment any more effectively now than it has been in the past.</br></br>On the basis of this testimony, the Subcommittee decided it was more appropriate for the U.S. to provide additional grant economic assistance rather than additional military loans that would just increase the Philippines' already onerous debt.</br></br>Therefore, the Subcommittee and later the full House decided that $60 million in military loans should be deferred this year, and that economic assistance should be increased by the same amount. Thus, under our proposal there was no net cut in aid but only a change in the mix.\n",

The country doesn't have enough savings to finance its own growth or debt load, so the finance minister must constantly bolster the confidence of international investors.</br></br>One of the first challenges faced by the new economic team will be the financing of about $16 billion in Argentine debt in global markets next year. The second challenge is to regain momentum on economic reforms. The Argentine peso is fixed to the U.S. dollar, and without additional policies that enhance productivity or lower costs, Argentine companies risk losing competitiveness. Mr. De la Rua's top pick for the Finance Ministry post appears to be 53-year-old Jose Luis Machinea, who heads a center-left think tank in Argentina. Mr. Machinea has a doctorate in economics from the University of Minnesota, and his peers say he is a smart economist steeped in economic theory.</br></br>Nevertheless, he is overshadowed by Argentina's instability during the late 1980s when he was central bank president. He left that post in March 1989, and shortly thereafter, following a failed stabilization plan, Argentine inflation spiraled out of control. Mr. Machinea doesn't have the unqualified support of Argentine businessmen or international investors, but he is working to gain their confidence.</br></br>There are concerns about whether his center-left tendencies might translate into an acceptance of mild forms of protectionism or subsidies, but few doubt his macroeconomic orthodoxy. \"He wouldn't generate applause,\" says Aldo Abram, general-director of Exante, an economic consulting firm here, but \"it wouldn't worry me a bit if he was minister.\"\n",

But economists see those gains as too small relative to what was lost in previous years to suggest a full-blown revival. Factories fell so hard, the logic goes, some gains are a given.</br></br>\"There's simply no statistical evidence of a broader renaissance at this point,\" says Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist with the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, an Arlington, Va., group that represents mostly large U.S. producers.</br></br>Mr. Meckstroth says measures that look deeper inside the sector continue to flash warning signs. Take factory closings. For the past 13 years, the rate factories have been closing has been declining. That's good. The trouble is the rate of openings has been falling even faster. Simply put, America's factories are dying faster than they're being born.</br></br>To be sure, many U.S. manufacturers are doing better than they have in some time. That's visible in hiring. Manufacturers have added more than 500,000 jobs since early 2010, and Monday's report from the Institute for Supply Management is expected to show manufacturers continued expanding in March. But those gains pale compared with the deep hole created during the recession and just before it: U.S. factories lost nearly 5.7 million jobs from 2000 to 2010.\n",

Higher oil prices helped fuel the rise, and economists also blamed some of the import surge on year-2000 stockpiling, in which many U.S. car dealers built up their inventories in the latter part of 1999.</br></br>But as the trade imbalance continued to swell, there was a tiny ray of sunshine in the November numbers: U.S. export performance, dismal for much of 1999, was slightly improved, rising $557 million to $82.89 billion on increased demand for telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and other products.</br></br>Imports, as usual, outperformed exports, swelling to $109.39 billion from October's $107.90 billion. It was the U.S.'s worst trade performance since the Commerce Department started compiling the monthly numbers in 1992.</br></br>While steadily climbing trade deficits are worrisome politically, they leave many economists sanguine. \"The buildup of precautionary inventories ahead of Y2K probably pulled in a few more exports during the fourth quarter,\" said Mark Vitner, economist with First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. \"The continued strength in the U.S. economy, however, is the most important reason imports remain so strong.\"\n",

            "TEXT --->  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Fannie Mae has threatened several large financial services firms that had opposed Fannie's interests in Congress. According to statements by the CEOs of AIG, Wells Fargo and GE Capital Services, they, or their firms, were told that Fannie would withdraw its business from them if they remained active in FM Watch, an organization that seeks to limit Fannie's expansion beyond its traditional role in the secondary mortgage markets. Fannie's chairman Franklin Raines, as well as a Fannie spokeswoman, have both denied that such threats were made, but when CEOs of major companies go public with statements of this gravity they must be taken seriously.</br></br>This is not an ordinary commercial dispute, since Fannie Mae is not an ordinary company. Along with its smaller cousin, Freddie Mac, Fannie enjoys a government charter authorizing it to help create liquidity in the residential mortgage markets by purchasing mortgages from banks and others and guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities. Although both Fannie and Freddie are now listed on the New York Stock Exchange, they have so many links to government -- including a special line of credit at the Treasury -- that they are called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs.</br></br>As a result, the capital markets do not believe they will be allowed to fail, and provide them with financing at a rate only slightly higher than the Treasury's own borrowing costs. With this government backing and financial advantage, Fannie and Freddie have grown to enormous size and profitability. Today, they carry on their books the credit risk of over 40% of all residential mortgages in the U.S. and are by far the most dominant players in the residential mortgage markets. It is fair to say that if a company is denied the opportunity to sell its mortgages to Fannie or Freddie, or the opportunity to underwrite or deal in Fannie or Freddie securities, it will suffer serious financial harm.</br></br>If Mr. Raines or Fannie did threaten these companies, that is the reason why his threat was menacing. Fannie Mae is to the residential mortgage markets what Microsoft is to computers, with one major exception: Fannie enjoys government backing. Fannie's market power derives from its government connection -- from the fact that it holds, in effect, a government monopoly. A threat from Fannie's chairman, then, is roughly equivalent to the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board threatening to ruin a bank that opposes the Fed in Congress. Such a threat would be seen as a serious matter, out of order for a government official and considerably more serious than the threats that Microsoft is alleged to have made against rivals.</br></br>This episode should alert us to dangers inherent in GSEs. They are sometimes praised as providing private-sector efficiency in the pursuit of government policies, without direct government expenditure. Unfortunately, the true costs are hidden or deferred. In the mid-1980s, Congress had to spend billions to bail out the Farm Credit System, another GSE. And the costs are often not simply financial. While we value the aggressiveness and efficiencies of private enterprises in their pursuit of profit, when these characteristics are hitched to the power of the government through a government-granted monopoly, they can dominate and distort otherwise competitive markets.\n",

Oddly, though, it will be months -- or even years -- before economists know for sure if the U.S. has entered one, partly because the definition is fluid.</br></br>The most common definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. This was the explanation President Clinton used to defend his legacy when reporters asked whether President-elect George W.

His introductory economics textbook, \"Principles of Economics,\" defines a recession more generally as \"a period of declining real incomes and rising unemployment.\" In some cases, he says, two quarters may be too much. \"If you had a big enough fall in one quarter, you'd probably call that a recession, too,\" he says.</br></br>For professional economists, the ultimate arbiter of economic peaks and troughs is the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee. \"Basically, a recession is whatever they want to call a recession,\" says Mr. Mankiw.</br></br>The NBER is a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank devoted to promoting the understanding of how the economy works.

Conservative critics of the 104th Congress complain that it went directly from the ancien regime to Thermidor, without any intervening revolution.</br></br>The deflation of their aspirations is symbolized by Newt Gingrich brandishing buckets in which ice had been delivered to congressional offices since before the invention of refrigeration. The Commerce and Education departments may not be finished, but ice deliveries are, so there.</br></br>Some depressed conservatives -- one of them calls the 104th \"the Bush administration in drag\" -- may think that the end of the 104th was in its beginning, in its opening day hoopla, which included, among much else, a children's party featuring the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Newt Gingrich. Back then it was hard to have any Washington gathering of two or more without having the speaker speak, and at the children's party he stuffed into the wee minds this explanation of the event's Larger Meaning: \"We wanted the Power Rangers here because they're multiethnic role models in which women and men play equally strong roles.\"</br></br>There has been too much blather, much of it from Gingrich, who has paid dearly for his refusal to heed the advice given to him -- early and often -- that he ration the portions of himself that he serves to the public. Still, measuring the 104th against history rather than its own rhetoric, it was a remarkably consequential Congress.</br></br>Intelligent people differ concerning the prudence of the 104th's most important act -- repeal of a 60-year-old entitlement to welfare. But the repeal ranks with the 1981 tax cuts, Medicare, the 1964 and 1965 Civil Rights Acts and the Taft-Hartley Act as one of the most momentous legislative acts of the past six decades.\n",

Roger Wilkins reports.</br></br>Only 12 blocks from the money and power of downtown Washington, Shaw is bordered by North Capitol Street, 15th Street NW, M Street and Florida Avenue. Years ago, Shaw was the home of Duke Ellington, black educators and lawyers and champions of women's rights.</br></br>But after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, parts of Shaw were burned in the backlash of rioting. Since then, Shaw has fallen on hard, even mean, times. Its people gained little from the civil rights advances of that decade. Its middle class moved out, jobs grew scarce, and the insidious drug trade undermined conventional work and destroyed families.</br></br>Now Shaw is home to a black underclass comprised of high-school dropouts, the jobless, single mothers trying to keep their children off the streets, addicts, crack dealers and their cadre.</br></br>In a metropolitan area where the average family earns more than $50,000 annually, infant mortality in Shaw is three times higher than anywhere else in the industrialized world, says Wilkins.\n",

            "TEXT --->  Price volatility has left the bond market. Volatility not only measures the change in price of bonds, but also the depth and breadth of that change. The volatility on 30-year Treasury bonds is currently around 7.50 percent, down from the 22 percent to 24 percent level incurred in 1986.</br></br>Another good measure of volatility is the change in yield levels in the different bond sectors over the past several years. By checking the change from the high yield to the low yield in a particular year, one can determine a measure of the volatility in that sector. The change in price is reflected in the change in yield.</br></br>The yield swings in 30-year Treasury bonds, from high to low, have been as follows: 1982, 421 basis points; 1983, 170 basis points; 1984, 245 basis points; 1985, 258 basis points; 1986, 239 basis points, and so far in 1987, a mere 33 basis points. At the beginning of 1987, the yield on the 30-year was 7.39 percent, and it now stands at 7.50 percent, a spread of only 11 basis points. Similiar yield swings existed in the municipal market over the same years.</br></br>There are several reasons why volatility has been squeezed out of the bond markets. Perhaps the most important factor is the diminished role of the Federal Reserve in the Treasury market. In the past, most fixed-income investors have looked for guidance by attempting to perceive the Fed's monetary policy. Economic data was closely monitored to see how it would influence the Fed's policy, while the federal funds rate was scrutinized as a true indicator of the Fed's intent.</br></br>In the past, the Fed would ease credit to stimulate the economy, but now it is perceived that the economy will largely improve through the reduction of the trade deficit.\n",

            "TEXT --->  NEW YORK -- In the perennial pursuit of the American dream -- an affordable home -- home buyers have been snapping up adjustable-rate mortgages.</br></br>But just as ardently, investors are shying away from securities backed by adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs. From the investors' point of view, the home buyers are getting too good a deal.</br></br>And that could mean bad news down the line for home buyers. While consumers are already being forced to bend somewhat, mortgage market participants say they may have to accept a harsher jolt: higher interest rates and less restrictive interest-rate \"caps,\" or limits.</br></br>Adjustable-rate mortgages account for about two-thirds of all new mortgages and are credited with having sheltered housing from the higher interest rates that have prevailed in the capital markets. Securities firms made a fortune turning fixed-rate mortgages into securities and selling them to investors, and in the process they helped bail out hard-pressed thrifts and other mortgage lenders. Now they would like to do the same with adjustable-rate mortgages.</br></br>At the moment, success seems remote. Investors say adjustable-rate mortgages simply aren't all that adjustable. Most of those available limit the yearly rate adjustments to 1% to 2%, and set a lifetime, or maximum, cap on total increases at five to 7.5 percentage points. But swings in interest rates can be far greater.\n",

And customers such as hedge funds would be required to post collateral meeting regulatory minimums.</br></br>The combined effect would be akin to a tax on leveraged trading, making it more expensive for banks to provide short-term credit to the customers of their trading desks. The very likely result is a long-term reduction in trading activity and slimmer profits.</br></br>Mr. Tarullo also outlined Fed plans to impose a risk-based capital surcharge on the most systemically important banks.

            "TEXT --->  Life is full of little ironies. So also is the Maryland budget. Three years ago, Maryland, like 43 other states, had a deficit driven by the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R), then a gubernatorial candidate, accused the outgoing administration of Parris N. Glendening of engaging in a \"scorched- earth spending spree.\" Republicans called the Democratic governor \"Parris Spendening.\"</br></br>But what became of all that \"scorched earth\" spending? Did Ehrlich reduce \"Spendening\" spending levels? Hardly. If you accept the doubtful premise that Glendening's spending was \"scorched earth,\" then Ehrlich's spending has reached incendiary levels.</br></br>When he left office, Glendening's final general-fund budget proposal was $10.4 billion. Ehrlich's baseline general-fund budget this year is expected to be $3.2 billion higher than that, an increase of almost one-third in just three years. During this period, Ehrlich has ignored state spending affordability guidelines.</br></br>For years, Republicans in Maryland campaigned on the need to rein in state spending. Since Ronald Reagan was president, it has been a GOP shibboleth that government at all levels is riddled with \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" But after three years in control of the governorship, Ehrlich's budgets implicitly acknowledge that state spending is not easily cut and that governments tend to spend what they take in.</br></br>The initial Republican apologia for Ehrlich's spending will be to blame the Democratic legislature. This is a constitutional impossibility. Maryland's governors enjoy more expansive budget powers than any of the nation's 49 other state chief executives. With limited exception, no state spending can occur without first being proposed by the governor. The biggest exception has been mandated funding, such as the Thornton aid-to-education formula -- and Ehrlich declined to sign or veto that when it was presented to him for reaffirmation.\n",

            "TEXT --->  With U.S. economic growth slowing, the nation's unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent last month while employers' payrolls grew only modestly, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>Analysts said the report provided further confirmation that growth has slowed recently from the very rapid pace of the first half of this year, which many economists and policymakers regarded as unsustainable. However, the details showed little sign of excessive weakness that would point to a serious slump.</br></br>While employers added 94,000 workers to their payrolls, the total number of hours worked last month fell 0.2 percent as firms cut back slightly on the length of the average workweek. The reduction was sharpest in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls were virtually unchanged but hours worked dropped by 0.7 percent.</br></br>\"It looks pretty favorable to me,\" said economist James Glassman of Chase Securities in New York. \"You have more confirmation of the slowing in growth, but not so much that unemployment is rising sharply. If you could freeze everything where it is now, it would be just about perfect.</br></br>\"Growth has slowed to a sustainable rate, workers' pay is going up and inflation fears are waning,\" Glassman said. \"Everybody has gotten gloomy about the outlook because of companies warning about profits and the stock market is down. In financial markets, there is stress and worry about credit problems. But to me this is all part of the process of cooling off from a superheated growth rate.\"\n",

            "TEXT --->  Even as we tremble at the edge of a fiscal cliff, the culture war insists on our attention. Abortion, contraception, gay and women's rights, and welfare have all returned to shake up an election season that was supposed to be a simple economy slugfest. Robert O. Self's \"All in the Family\" could help explain why. Mr. Self, a professor of history at Brown University, has heroically researched the history of the culture wars from the early 1960s to the present. He offers a provocative analysis that accounts for today's alliance between small-government and social conservatives, on the one hand, and welfare-state and social liberals, on the other.</br></br>Mr. Self begins his history by describing \"breadwinner liberalism\" as the status quo of the early and mid-1960s. The architects of the Great Society assumed the primacy of male-earner and female-homemaker families. Labor unions fought for a family wage for their predominantly male membership, the Moynihan Report (1965) raised alarms about black male unemployment, and the first efforts at affirmative action took the form of quotas in municipal contracts for male construction workers. In all these cases \"women were largely an afterthought,\" Mr. Self writes. Breadwinner liberalism, he argues, was based on a model of \"masculine individualism\": hardworking, striving, self-reliant.</br></br>By the late 1960s, male breadwinners were beset from all sides. Their antiwar sons grew their hair long and scoffed at verities about masculine honor. Gays, going public early in the decade as self-defined \"homophiles,\" challenged presumptions about masculine sexuality. Traditional men watched anxiously as their wives brought home paychecks and as women generally demanded relief from sexual harassment, low pay and pink-collar ghettos. Men soon saw their daughters demonstrating for abortion rights. Between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and various court decisions, it seemed as if the government, the courts and their own families all agreed: The traditional male-headed family was an anachronism.</br></br>But, the author concludes, breadwinning men weren't disappearing; they and their female supporters were just changing political parties. For many lower-middle-class women serving coffee to bosses and stocking grocery shelves, full-time motherhood wasn't the concentration camp described by feminists. They found a voice in antifeminists like Phyllis Schlafly, who almost single-handedly stopped the Equal Rights Amendment in the late 1970s. Catholic women and men organized groups to oppose abortion and were soon joined by evangelicals. Other grass-root groups emerged, some in support of Vietnam veterans and others celebrating what came to be known as family values. What was taking shape was the profound class and cultural divide that vexes our politics to this day.</br></br>In a vivid chapter, Mr. Self describes the 1972 Democratic National Convention, a pivotal moment in the reshaping of political alignments. AFL-CIO President George Meany railed that, in the party platform, \"there were no steelworkers, no pipe fitters, and worst of all, no plumbers.\" Instead there were feminists, radical blacks, Chicanos and gays--co-conspirators in a left-wing attack on breadwinner liberalism. In reaction, a constellation of religious, white, \"ethnic\" and anti-feminist objectors joined forces to create \"breadwinner conservatism.\" By 1980, with the help of a vigorous evangelical revival, these one-time Democrats helped elect Ronald Reagan president.\n",

Canada does, however, allow people to write off up to 50% of the cost of business entertainment, such as tickets to the opera or hockey games.</br></br>The golf industry says that's unfair. A coalition of golfing associations and owners of the country's 2,300 courses -- including ClubLink Enterprises Ltd., auto-parts magnate Frank Stronach and smaller operators -- said the direct and indirect economic impact of golf spending is 14.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$13.12 billion) a year, or roughly 1% of Canada's gross domestic product.</br></br>About 1.5 million Canadians play golf, according to Statistics Canada, while 1.3 million lace up for recreational ice hockey.</br></br>\"It's blatant unfairness in government legislation,\" said Jeff Calderwood, head of Canada's National Golf Course Owners Association, which commissioned a report on golf's economic impact.

Edward Smith of the Titanic realized his ship was going down -- six watertight compartments breached, less than two hours to float -- yet his passengers slept in happy ignorance. A historical fate hardened while most of the participants dreamed on.</br></br>The jobs report last week opened a long gash beneath the waterline of President Obama's legislative agenda. Few realize it, but a scramble for lifeboats is about to begin.</br></br>On closer inspection, the economic news, which seemed bad, is even worse. Not only did unemployment rise to 9.5 percent but wages fell, undermining the consumption needed to revive a consumption-driven economy. Unemployment increased among \"breadwinners\" -- married men and women who head households -- also making major family purchases more difficult. Recent increases in unemployment benefits and food stamps have helped many Americans pay for food and rent. Jobs, however, are what lead to the purchase of furniture, cars and homes. Paired with a decline in business investment, these trends make a second-half recovery less likely.</br></br>The stimulus package hasn't been very stimulating -- as many economists predicted. Pouring money into the economy through a thirsty sponge of federal programs -- the preferred method of Congress -- is slow and inefficient. In retrospect, all of the stimulus funds should have been given to individuals directly from the tap.</br></br>Obama's spending ambitions would have been jaw-dropping even in the best of economic times. Federal spending this year is about 28 percent of gross domestic product -- a figure exceeded only when Franklin Roosevelt was fighting a global war against Germany and Japan. Along the fiscal path Obama has chosen (according to the Congressional Budget Office) our national debt will more than double in 10 years and will amount to 82 percent of the entire economy.\n",

            "TEXT --->  FRANKFURT -- No matter what rhetoric it uses, the European Central Bank has to keep raising interest rates in lockstep with the U.S. Federal Reserve -- or risk an even sharper decline to the already sinking euro. With the U.S economy growing so strongly and signs of inflation beginning to emerge, the Fed is firmly on the path toward higher U.S. interest rates. That puts strong pressure on the ECB to lift European rates -- even beyond what is necessary to control European growth pressures.</br></br>For some of the smaller ECB member countries, this is an ironic change of circumstances. In the years prior to the formation of the ECB, less economically advanced countries often complained of being held hostage to the monetary policy of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, over which they had no say. Germany was, and still is, the major economic power in Europe and to remain on a level playing field with Germany, other central banks had to follow the Bundesbank's lead.</br></br>But with the ECB, the rest of Europe thought they would finally have a voice. Instead, they now feel they're hostage to Alan Greenspan.</br></br>The euro, the shared currency of 11 nations, has lost 24% of its value against the dollar since its inception in January 1999. For many reasons, global investors appear to prefer to put money in the U.S. instead of Europe, and the European currency is suffering as a result.</br></br>To name a few: ever-stronger economic reports from the U.S. and relatively weaker performance of Europe; the magnetic U.S. stock market; political uncertainty in Italy; the likelihood of highly indebted Greece, though economically insignificant, joining the euro next year; the investigation of Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the Bank of France and heir apparent to the ECB president, for possible wrongdoings when he was in the French treasury; the inability of Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG to pull off a merger; and the resignation of the European Commission's executive body last year.

We are used to thinking that central banks' main task is to guide the economy by setting interest rates. Central banks' main tools used to be \"open-market\" operations, i.e. purchasing short-term Treasury debt, and short-term lending to banks.</br></br>Since the 2008 financial crisis, however, the Federal Reserve has intervened in a wide variety of markets, including commercial paper, mortgages and long-term Treasury debt. At the height of the crisis, the Fed lent directly to teetering nonbank institutions, such as insurance giant AIG, and participated in several shotgun marriages, most notably between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.</br></br>These \"nontraditional\" interventions are not going away anytime soon. Many Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, see \"credit constraints\" and \"segmented markets\" throughout the economy, which the Fed's standard tools don't address. Moreover, interest rates near zero have rendered those tools nearly powerless, so the Fed will naturally search for bigger guns. In his speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Bernanke made it clear that \"we should not rule out the further use of such [nontraditional] policies if economic conditions warrant.\"</br></br>But the Fed has crossed a bright line. Open-market operations do not have direct fiscal consequences, or directly allocate credit. That was the price of the Fed's independence, allowing it to do one thing--conduct monetary policy--without short-term political pressure. But an agency that allocates credit to specific markets and institutions, or buys assets that expose taxpayers to risks, cannot stay independent of elected, and accountable, officials.</br></br>In addition, the Fed is now a gargantuan financial regulator. Its inspectors examine too-big-to-fail banks, come up with creative \"stress tests\" for them to pass, and haggle over thousands of pages of regulation. When we think of the Fed 10 years from now, on current trends, we're likely to think of it as financial czar first, with monetary policy the boring backwater.\n",

On the contrary, however, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that today's immigrants are acculturating and moving up the economic ladder like previous generations.</br></br>The media's tendency to report \"averages\" in educational attainment, English-language skills, income and other traditional measures of assimilation can make it difficult to determine whether immigrants are making gains. Since Latino immigration continues, averaging together the poverty rates or homeownership levels of large numbers of people who arrived recently with those who have been here for decades can provide a skewed view of progress.</br></br>Measuring assimilation properly requires following the same immigrants over generations. And the good news is that longitudinal studies that take this approach show that Latino immigrants have made gains similar to other groups who preceded them.</br></br>Consider the claim that Hispanic immigrants are rejecting English in favor of a separate Spanish-speaking culture. Census data from 2005 show that only one-third of immigrants in the country for less than a decade speak English well, but that number climbs to nearly three-quarters for those here for 30 years or more.</br></br>A 2007 Pew study of 14,000 Latino adults showed that while just 23% of immigrants report being able to speak English very well, \"fully 88% of their U.S.-born adult children report that they speak English very well.

The government said its stock purchases were meant to reflect the broad market, and were aimed at hurting financial speculators who were selling stocks and futures as a way of pressuring the Hong Kong dollar lower. The Hong Kong currency is linked to the U.S. dollar, but some investors are trying to force Hong Kong to break that peg.</br></br>The government's approach to last week's intervention has raised hackles. The government is led by Tung Chee-hwa, a former shipping magnate who is close to the handful of powerful tycoons who control much of this city's wealth. His cabinet is a virtual plutocracy of senior business leaders, whose popularity has sagged along with the economy this year. Last month the government's public-opinion poll showed that 54% of the population was dissatisfied with its performance, more than twice last year's disapproval rating.</br></br>Because the intervention boosted the stock market sharply Friday, some market participants wondered whether the intervention was meant to distract from gloomy financial news coming this week.

Preferred shares trade like stocks and are a claim on the assets and earnings of a company, just like common shares. But they hold a higher claim on the assets than common stock. That makes preferreds a somewhat safer investment.</br></br>While preferred shares usually don't have voting rights, they pay a regular dividend that can be substantial, making them similar in some ways to bonds. Dividends paid by preferred shares usually must be paid out before common shareholders receive their dividends.</br></br>\"Preferred shares are slightly more like bonds than stocks as their historical price volatility more closely matches that of bonds,\" says Andrew Zimmerman, chief investment strategist at DT Investment Partners LLC. Just like bonds, they can be called by the issuer in times of falling interest rates, he notes.</br></br>\"Since preferred shares are sensitive to interest-rate movements, their prices fall when interest rates rise and vice versa,\" he says. \"However, since they offer such relatively high yields, the income component of preferred shares can help to offset the price decline in periods of small interest-rate spikes.\"\n",

Your Dec. 26 page-one article \"Jobless Puzzle\" described a trendy theory among academicians that the roots of unemployment lie in the \"efficiency-wage\" problem: unemployment persists because employers are paying artificially high wages in order to motivate workers to greater productivity. This prevents workers who are willing to work at a lower wage from finding jobs.</br></br>My experience indicates otherwise. I lived in a low-income ghetto and there had a string of housemates who were unemployed when they moved in, yet healthy, young and clearly in possession of employable skills. Without exception, these men failed to follow up on job leads I gave them, they walked past help-wanted signs every day, they even refused my offer to pay them generously for household chores. They chose instead to borrow from friends during the times that their government checks for unemployment and disability (it was a fraud) fell short of their needs.</br></br>This experience was a limited one yet I believe representative of a far broader problem. The men I lived with chose unemployment because it presented them with an economically desirable alternative to a life of work. Theirs was a low standard of living yet one they had grown accustomed to and complacent with.

The rate for the so-called core portion of the index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also lifted by the same amount, to 2.7 percent.</br></br>Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of labor statistics, said at a press briefing the problem first arose in January 1999 when the agency began using a significantly different sample of housing units to collect rent information. However, she said, the CPI figures for 1999 were not revised because the agency decided the changes were too small to warrant all the problems such a revision would cause for everyone who uses the CPI to adjust benefits, pay, rents and even parts of the tax code for inflation.</br></br>\"It would be enormously disruptive for the whole gamut of users of this information\" if the 1999 figures had been revised, Abraham said, adding that her agency's guidelines for such matters say \"we should not be revising too far back in time.\"</br></br>The agency will not know until next month, when it has the September price figures, whether the changes announced yesterday will affect next year's cost-of-living increases in Social Security payments, veterans' benefits and federal pensions.

            "TEXT --->  One of the more important deficit-reducing events of the 1980s was the Social Security reform of 1983. The Social Security system is now running sizable surpluses that are being used to help meet federal deficit targets under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The Social Security surplus thus masks the seriousness of the deficit problem in the rest of government.</br></br>For this reason, many propose that deficit targeting be altered. They would target the rest of the government's deficit and move Social Security completely off-budget. While I am in strong agreement with the goals of the reformers, I worry that they are pursuing their goals with a highly risky mechanism.</br></br>Following such a change, increases in Social Security benefits would no longer count against the official budget deficit. Given the strong political support for Social Security, the removal of budget discipline from the system would create an enormous temptation for politicians to spend some of the accumulated surplus. There is a long list of claimants and many expensive proposals have been made to correct perceived inequities in the system.</br></br>Having allowed Social Security completely off-budget, it would be hard not to extend the same privilege to other trust funds. For example, the Medicare and civil-service pension trust funds would have a particularly strong claim to off-budget status. Both programs have contributed significantly to deficit reduction in the recent past. But if allowed off-budget, they are unlikely to do so in the future.</br></br>More important, the Social Security benefit structure itself should not be allowed to escape budget scrutiny forever. Formidable political forces are now arrayed against any restraint on benefit growth, and Social Security is far from the political bargaining table. But that has not always been true, and there are reasonable options that would save many billions of dollars in the long run.\n",

            "TEXT --->  The statistics on the enormous costs of employee drug abuse are well known (at least $70 billion per year, according to December 1985 testimony before the House Labor Subcommittee on Health and Safety). Management is under pressure to reduce productivity losses, turnover, insurance costs and the risk of lawsuits for personal and property damage caused by drug-impaired workers. Management also is under sales pressure from a growing cadre of laboratories, test-kit manufacturers and consultants who extol the virtues of testing. A common argument is the following: \"Your competitors are starting to require drug tests. If you don't, their work force will be clean and you will end up with all the junkies.\"</br></br>Many companies that have implemented widespread drug-testing programs, however, have learned that there is a downside to testing. They have experienced the protests of employees and civil libertarians and have watched the proliferation of lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, defamation and other legal theories. A Texas railroad employee was awarded $200,000 in damages when his employer misreported the results of a drug test. Numerous other cases are pending.</br></br>Is there a middle ground? Can safety and efficiency be protected without invading the privacy of applicants and employees?</br></br>A growing number of companies have concluded that drug testing should be the least important part of a comprehensive drug-abuse program. The starting point is a drug-awareness program to educate managers, supervisors and employees about the dangers and signs of drug abuse. The second part of the program is an effective employee-assistance program (EAP). Rehabilitation is preferable to punishment or dismissal (at least for initial or nonserious offenses) because it encourages employees to seek help voluntarily, improves labor relations and is cost-effective by restoring valuable employees to productive status. More than one company that heedlessly adopted a \"screen and fire\" policy on drugs had second thoughts after discovering traces of drugs in some of their most productive employees.</br></br>There may be a place for drug testing in a company's drug-abuse program, but there are limits to the effectiveness of testing. To begin with, the accuracy of some drug tests varies widely, and the test results are often unacceptable even when performed by professional laboratories. Last year the Centers for Disease Control published the results of a 10-year study of laboratory testing for amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, codeine, methadone and morphine. Virtually all of the laboratories in the study had unacceptably high error rates.\n",

Their way of choosing between the unpleasant alternatives over the years has been not to choose but to resort to subterfuge. The slipperiness of the system has become worse than the reality it is meant to hide.</br></br>The latest example has to do with a vote that Congress took in 1954 to forgive itself some taxes. It adopted a provision, still in effect, allowing each member to deduct as business expenses up to $3,000 a year of living expenses here in Washington. Inflation, of course, has greatly eroded the value of the deduction. In the House Ways and Means Committee, which is considering a bill to make \"technical corrections\" to the code, proposals have been made to lift and even remove the ceiling on the deductible amount.</br></br>The rationale for the 1954 provision is that it merely puts members of Congress on the same footing as all other taxpayers, who are allowed to deduct uncompensated travel, lodging and other such expenses when away from home on business. The congressmen are also said to be away from \"home,\" by which is meant their districts.</br></br>The trouble is that Washington is in fact where most members principally live. Business trips for them are the trips they regularly take back to their districts. The reason they don't want to make these deductible is that they've already given themselves allowances to cover most of the cost. The allowances are legitimate, but would make a deduction less valuable; it would be redundant.</br></br>A deduction for living costs in Washington has no such disadvantage. It is pure lamb chop; it puts congressmen on a very different footing from all other taxpayers. They can deduct things-the cost of everyday housing, food, the car-that the average citizen cannot.\n",

But she said she was pleased that the House dropped its insistence on a minimum price of $1.7 billion, which investment advisers had warned could kill the sale outright.</br></br>Congress's $2 billion goal represents a projected sale price of $1.7 billion for the government's 85% stake in the Northeast railroad, and the transfer of up to $300 million to government coffers from Conrail's ample cash reserves.</br></br>Lawmakers set the goal before they settled on more stringent tax treatment for Conrail than the administration wanted. Analysts estimate the tax decision could depress the sale price by $200 million to $500 million.\n",

At certain times, market analysts say, investors can get torpedoed by these hidden assumptions.</br></br>For instance, buying stocks with high dividends, as many investors have since last fall's stock market crash, tends to produce a portfolio that lags the market in a rally.

Stocks judged by their price-earnings ratios may look most attractive just before they're ready to tumble -- or terrible just when they're bottoming out.</br></br>\"It doesn't do much good to know the price-earnings ratio or the (capitalization) of a stock unless you know how those characteristics relate to the behavior of financial markets,\" says Stephen A.

            "TEXT --->  The more we hear about the deadly Sept. 16 shootout in Baghdad involving contractors from the private military firm Blackwater USA, the worse it sounds. Despite investigations by the Iraqi government, the FBI and your department and last week's House hearings, we may never fully know what happened in the chaos that hospital records show left at least 14 Iraqis dead and 18 wounded. (The contractors claim that they were fired on first, while Iraqi witnesses and officials say that the Blackwater guards opened fire on a small car, carrying a couple and their child, that wouldn't get out of the way in a busy traffic circle.) But by now, we do know a great deal about the business of relying on hired guns -- more than enough to convince you that the Pentagon and State Department urgently need to change their ways.</br></br>By your own department's count, more than 160,000 for-hire personnel are working in Iraq today, which, amazingly, is greater than the number of uniformed military personnel there. These private forces perform all sorts of key functions, such as moving fuel, ammunition and food, as well as protecting top U.S. officials and guarding bases and convoys. Handing those tasks over to U.S. troops would further overstretch a military that you've warned is already dangerously overstretched. Hence the allure of outsourcing the jobs to private firms. But while we can't go to war without 'em, we also can't win with 'em. Our military outsourcing has become an addiction, and we're headed straight for a crash.</br></br>We've done poorly at a cold cost-benefit analysis here. It's far from clear that contractors save us money; when pressed on this score by the House last week, Blackwater Chairman Erik Prince went from claiming cost savings to pleading ignorance of his own firm's profits. (He did, however, let slip that he makes at least $800,000 per year more than you do, for overseeing a force that's a tiny fraction of the size.) Oversight has been miserably lacking, as has the will to use civilian or military law to hold contractors accountable for bloody messes such as the Baghdad shootings. On balance, for all the important jobs that contractors are doing, Blackwater and its kin have harmed, rather than helped, our troops' counterinsurgency efforts.</br></br>Lets policymakers dodge tough, politically costly decisions, which makes for bad operational choices. Since the end of the Vietnam War, the United States has sought to ensure that there's a link between the public and the costs of war, so that good decisions would be made and an ethos of responsibility fostered. With about half our operation in Iraq in private hands, that link has been jeopardized.</br></br>Encourages a \"bigger is better\" approach to operations, contrary to the best lessons of U.S. military strategy. Turning logistics and operations into a for-profit endeavor helped feed the \"Green Zone mentality\" of having Americans huddle inside sprawling bases in Iraq. Bigger bases may yield bigger profits for the private firms, but they also entail an isolation that runs counter to everything your field commander, Gen. David H. Petraeus, told us we need to win a counterinsurgency campaign in the new Army-Marine Corps manual he helped write.\n",

It has been an American institution for most of this century. Like most institutions, it has been criticized on many occasions.</br></br>The form of criticisra has varied, at times even being directed at the compilers of the data. For example, in 1970, Nixon aide Frederick Maiek investigated the religious identity of the senior BLS staff, presumably to test the hypothesis that oneÛªs religion affects how one would compile national statistics. But while they varied in form, the criticisms have usually been from the same perspectiveÛÓthey claim the CPI goes up too fast.</br></br>As the century draws to a close, the CPI is undergoing another onslaughtÛÓthis time from the Federal Reserve Board and the new House of Representatives. And the Senate Finance Committee is scheduling hearings on the subject soon, for which it has asked the BLS to provide testimony.</br></br>The Federal Reserve staff apparently thinks the CPI goes up faster than it should. Its research on the subject has not been published, but Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that if those upward biases were eliminated, $150 billion could be cut from the federal deficit over the next five years. That prospect is enticing to many politicians who want to cut Social Security benefits or raise income taxes, both of which are indexed by the CPI.</br></br>The Federal Reserve criticisms emphasize biases that stem from the index formula the BLS uses and the way certain price changes are measured. Theory and evidence, much of it provided by BLS researchers, suggest these can be sources of upward bias. Another problem frequently alleged to impart bias is quality change measurementÛÓmaking sure that the item priced this month has the same characteristics as last month's and, when it does not, adjusting the price to reflect the quality difference.\n",

(Published 2/7/92)</br></br>Ask Americans their opinion of the U.S. health care system, as poll after poll has done, and the majority say it is in need of major reform. But ask them how they like the quality of the care they receive personally and they say just the opposite: They are well satisfied.</br></br>This is the paradox faced by President Bush today as he unveils his administration's long-awaited health care reform package, a paradox that has bedeviled all those debating how to fix the U.S. health care system. How it is that a problem of such apparent gravity remains an abstraction for so many Americans? How can a system be so bad if it leaves so many so happy?</br></br>The answer, according to health care experts, is that the three distinct problems at the heart of the health care crisis - that health care dollars are spent unwisely; that the nation's health care bill is rising too rapidly; and that the burden of paying that bill is shared unequally - are largely invisible to the Americans passing through hospitals and doctors' offices.</br></br>This is, in the words of many pushing for reform, a crisis of the hidden infrastructure of the health care system. It involves the way that dollars flowing from employers and government agencies to medical providers and insurers often go to the wrong places, the wrong procedures and the wrong people, burdening some too much and others too little.\n",

Japanese investors also are expected to accelerate the diversification of their U.S. holdings away from bonds and into equities and real estate.</br></br>The major factors behind the expected shifts are the weak U.S. dollar and relatively low U.S. interest rates.</br></br>Salomon Brothers Inc. projects that private Japanese investors will purchase the equivalent of about $115 billion of foreign assets in 1987, down from a record $132.4 billion last year. Much of these funds are either invested in the U.S. or in Eurodollar bonds. The New York-based investment firm estimates that 85% to 90% of Japanese purchases of foreign stock and 70% of the fixed-income securities purchases have been dollar-denominated, including U.S. government, agency and corporate debt and Eurodollar securities.</br></br>A slowdown in new Japanese investment in the U.S. could have far-reaching implications. Foreign purchases of U.S. government and other dollar-denominated investments have helped fund the U.S. budget deficit, keep U.S. interest rates low and prevent the dollar from crashing. And the Japanese have played a leading role.</br></br>Japan's long-term foreign assets at the end of last year totaled nearly $397 billion -- higher than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' peak holdings of $380 billion in 1983. Japanese trading in U.S. Treasury securities climbed fivefold in the past 17 months and now accounts for as much as 15% of daily turnover, according to Michael R.

Wholesale prices are back to where they were in November. Retail prices have declined less quickly, but are well below late December levels.</br></br>In the wake of the rapid price movements, several federal, congressional and state investigations are still trying to determine whether the surge was engineered by the oil industry to increase profits, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration has concluded that it was a predictable response to a sudden very large increase in demand.</br></br>\"In the face of extraordinary and unexpected increases in demand,\" EIA said in a recent report to Congress, \"petroleum markets performed as might have been expected: The distribution system responded to temporary imbalances in supply and demand through higher prices, which were quickly followed by increased supplies and declining prices, approaching those of last November.\"</br></br>In the Washington area, where the price of home-delivered fuel oil soared from less than $1 per gallon to nearly $1.40 between Nov. 1 and Christmas, Steuart Petroleum Co. quoted a price of $1.149 this week. Another major distributor, A.P. Woodson Co., was charging $1.069.</br></br>\"Prices have come down faster than anyone believed they would,\" said Philip R.

The move came after a number of fund companies, including giant Fidelity Investments, experienced problems publishing accurate share prices for funds that held the stock of America Online Inc., which experienced year-end price swings on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, the last trading day of 1998. The swings caused confusion among mutual funds over the closing price for AOL that day.</br></br>The problems affected several wellknown funds, including Fidelity's Magellan Fund. In pricing shares of funds that held stock of the Internet company, several fund outfits initially used an incorrect, lower closing price for AOL when distributing per-share fund data to outlets for publication in newspapers and other uses.</br></br>As a result, the price that mutual-fund buyers were charged to purchase funds that held AOL stock was actually higher than the too-low price that appeared in their newspaper fund listings.</br></br>In a memo to fund companies, Nasdaq called on fund groups that may have a problem to \"correct the closing\" net-asset value of funds for 1998. The problem, Nasdaq officials say, is that end-of-year information is important in determining mutual-fund rankings and even tax issues that affect small investors.\n",

But the best news may lie in the future.</br></br>Analysts see in the recent jobless data signs of a significant change in the growth of the work force. \"We're switching from a decade in which the labor force grew faster than the population to one in which it will grow slower,\" William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Purdue University, says.</br></br>If this trend holds, the current decade could turn out to be the mirror image of the economically troubled 1970s. The work force exploded in the last decade as women and members of the \"baby boom\" generation sought jobs. \"We had some digestive problems,\" says Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, noting that in the 1970s the jobless rate rose, the rate of growth of worker productivity slowed and inflation soared. But in this decade, \"we may find ourselves able to do more on the employment front without causing an increase in inflation,\" Mr. Bosworth says.</br></br>Sidney Jones, the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, adds, \"After getting ourselves convinced that 6 1/2% is a natural rate of unemployment, it may be that we can do better than that.\"</br></br>An easing of labor-force growth could have other implications as well. For instance, older workers, who in recent years were pushed out of the labor market by early-retirement plans to make room for younger workers, may find themselves in more demand again. Mr. Dunkelberg believes that the retirement age is likely to rise during the current decade as employers, faced with shortages of new workers, rely on older workers to stay on the job longer.\n",

And that lifted the deficit for 2004 to $617.7 billion -- an all-time high that shattered the previous record, set in 2003, by 24 percent.</br></br>The trade report, issued yesterday by the Commerce Department, capped a year in which the voracious demand by Americans for imported goods drove the deficit to proportions all but unheard of for a major industrial country -- 5.3 percent of gross domestic product, up from 4.5 percent the year before. The widening gap has deepened worries that the United States is growing dangerously dependent on the capital lent by foreigners to cover the cost of the products they sell to Americans.</br></br>The December deficit decline to $56.4 billion from a revised record of $59.3 billion in November offered some hope that the trade gap's relentless surge might abate in coming months. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week that the deficit may soon start leveling off and possibly even shrink. Greenspan cited the dollar's fall against other currencies, which makes U.S.-made goods more competitive with products made abroad.</br></br>But yesterday's report offered insight into why a turnaround may be a long way off, because as the Commerce summary noted, imports increased nearly twice as much as exports last year. That is the opposite of what must happen for the deficit to narrow. Since the $1.764 trillion that the United States imported in 2004 is so much greater than the $1.146 trillion that it shipped abroad, exports must grow much faster than imports to close the gap.</br></br>\"The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply, but let's not get carried away,\" said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors, in a report to clients. \"The level is still the second highest we have ever recorded . . . the deficit is still way too wide.\"\n",

The retailer's shares dropped 11% on the news.</br></br>The forecast for the company's fiscal year ending Jan. 29 was the latest setback in an attempted turnaround, and came after a favorable third quarter. Much of the retail world is celebrating big holiday sales, driven by a strong economy and a surging stock market.</br></br>Toys \"R\" Us told analysts it was \"comfortable\" with a reduced earnings-per-share estimate of about $1.10 a share for the year, down from about $1.40. The company said it expects to post an operating loss of 20 cents a share to 25 cents a share in its Internet business for the year, also wider than earlier expectations.</br></br>Toys \"R\" Us's retail Web site had trouble handling volume over the holidays, and to placate customers, it offered discounts and free shipping. Those moves contributed to the operating loss, said Louis Lipschitz, chief financial officer.</br></br>For the crucial nine-week holiday season ended Jan. 1, sales in U.S. stores open at least a year fell 2% compared with the year-earlier period. Analysts had been expecting same-store sales to rise to the mid single-digit range.

As one of the region's most prosperous jurisdictions, Arlington was well positioned to ride out the recession, they said.</br></br>But with the county entering a fifth consecutive budget season facing a large revenue shortfall, that brand of optimism has begun to wane.

            "TEXT --->  Discussing the falling dollar at a panel of the World Economic Forum here, a former U.S. senator said the greenback's decline was just a blip. The abiding fact was that for more than a century, in good times and bad, the world's investors have been in love with the American economy. And that ardor continues today.</br></br>Yes, responded a Chinese economist, but \"love affairs always end.\" And, he might have added, new infatuations always begin -- as now seems to be the case with the Chinese economy.</br></br>Their exchange framed two key themes of this year's annual meeting of global economic leaders: first, the remarkable durability of the U.S. economy, which is surging again this year even though the dollar is weak, just as it did in the late 1990s, when the dollar was strong; and, second, the inexorable rise of China as a global economic superpower.</br></br>U.S. economic strength is probably the most important fact in this election year. On paper, the Bush administration's economic policies may seem profligate and potentially ruinous. But there was a consensus among business executives here that the falling dollar has been good for the U.S. economy. The cheaper dollar will stimulate demand for U.S. exports abroad and (in theory at least) reduce America's demand for imports. That should gradually lower the towering trade deficit.</br></br>The mood was upbeat even at a panel titled \"What if the Dollar Declines Another 20 Percent?\" The biggest worry was how a plummeting dollar would affect other economies. A former senior official of the Federal Reserve predicted a global redistribution of demand toward the United States and away from rising currencies such as the euro.\n",

ACS handles business processes and information technology for companies and government agencies to help them cut costs and focus on their core operations.</br></br>Xerox has forecast revenue will rise 4% to 6% next year, as it expects both itself and ACS will win contracts that neither business could have competed for individually.

The talk these days is \"tax revolt.\" A guy down the block is organizing the oppressed owners of $300,000 and $400,000 houses against the tyranny of taxes that are escalating along with home prices.</br></br>The property tax system was pretty much okay with most people as long as they didn't have too much property to be taxed. They accepted the principle of taxing property and the corollary that if you're going to base levies on people's accumulated wealth, you have to keep close track of how much wealth they have accumulated by regularly reassessing their property.</br></br>Now, however, folks who would never fudge a nickel on their 1040 forms have decided that equally accurate assessments of their property values are outrageous. Stunned by 60, 70 and 80 percent jumps in assessed values of their houses-and corresponding increases in property taxes-they're demanding a limit to assessment increases.

Strategists bullish throughout 1995's impressive stock market run have grown increasingly skittish about the market's prospects for the rest of this year. Among the reasons bearishness is so in vogue: speculative movement among small stocks and an overly aggressive investor lust for initial public offerings of any kind.</br></br>But at the same time, even as the talk grows more pessimistic, the folks with the hard cash continue to remain, well, fairly bullish. Mutual fund cash inflows are powerfully strong. Cash levels among institutional investors are stuck at aggressively low levels. Money managers, while nervously talking about rising interest rates and stretched valuations, continue to deploy new assets into the stock market. And analysts' estimates for 1996 earnings for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index companies have risen in four of the past five weeks, according to I/B/E/S International Inc., a research firm in New York.</br></br>\"People are talking a lot about being more nervous, but I sure don't see it reflected in the stock prices,\" says Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management. \"Part of the problem is that people are afraid of being out of the market. Though investors are talking more pessimistically, the one thing we've learned during the past year and a half is that being in cash is not the place to be.\"</br></br>Yes, holding cash can be deadly, which might explain why it's easier to try to call a market top than it is to move investments to reflect such sentiment. Jeffrey Vinik, late of Fidelity's Magellan Fund, learned the hard way that playing defense in this market can be immensely unrewarding. And many of the most outspoken and nervous bears concede that they have felt nervous and bearish for a long time.\n",

Ramsey said yesterday that he intends to fire five police officers and two civilian employees because their failures allowed the first 911 calls about a fatal house fire in Dupont Circle to be placed on hold.</br></br>Acting after weeks of complaints from neighborhood residents, Ramsey said he has recommended the firing of five police operators who were on duty but were \"unplugged\" instead of answering 911 calls when the fire began Jan. 15. He also moved to fire two of the operators' direct supervisors, one of whom is a police officer, and urged that two more supervisors face sanctions.</br></br>The chief's actions cover four of the five supervisors and five of 13 operators working at the city's emergency communications center the morning of the fire -- meaning that, in his view, half the police staff handling 911 calls during that shift made mistakes.</br></br>\"It is a very serious issue, and I think we're taking it very seriously,\" Ramsey said yesterday. He said that 911 is \"literally a lifeline to the community, and people need to take it seriously.

It changes government regulation by giving the Federal Reserve Board authority to oversee the new financial conglomerates.

Bond yields move inversely to prices.</br></br>The reversal was particularly brutal for holders of emerging-market bonds and Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, which compensate investors for rising inflation. Neither bet panned out as funds rushed out of poorer-country markets and U.S. inflation softened.

But Bernanke, facing criticism for his action, went on \"60 Minutes\" to explain why he's prepared to do even more.</br></br>He took the even more unusual step - for an economist - of using language that non-economists can understand. \"The unemployment rate is just not going down,\" he said in the interview, which aired Sunday night. \"Unemployment is just about the same as it was in mid-2009, when the economy started growing. . . . And it looks that at current rates, that it may take some years before the unemployment rate is down to more normal levels.\"</br></br>The jobless rate is a devastating 9.8 percent. Bernanke calculates that unless the recovery is somehow accelerated, it will take four or five years for unemployment to come down to a \"more normal\" range below 6 percent.\n",

In many communities well into the 1960s, these departments were white male enclaves, controlled by such European ethnic groups as Irish, Italian and Polish Americans.</br></br>The effect of government and civil rights challenges to these institutions has been dramatic: From 1960 to 1989, the number of black patrolmen and detectives grew nationally from 8,500, or 3.7 percent of the total, to 60,400 or 13.1 percent.

Along the sleek slate-and-steel hallway, activists from five continents clustered by the latte bars: African campaigners for debt relief, Brazilian defenders of rain forests, Indians opposed to neocolonial investment, European haters of beef hormones, Canadians concerned about everything.</br></br>Inside the auditorium, a marathon teach-in was underway, convened to denounce the World Trade Organization as \"one of the world's most powerful, secretive, undemocratic and dangerous bodies.\" And yet this festival of activism suggested a rather different notion. Perhaps the activists themselves are the real stealth world government?</br></br>Last time trade liberalizing talks were launched, in Uruguay in 1986, 12 nongovernmental organizations registered to observe the process. But the reach and clout of NGOs have since expanded marvelously, courtesy of the Internet. NGOs set the agenda for the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, and lobbied governments to attend; they publicized the Chiapas rebellion in Mexico in 1994, so preventing the Mexican government from suppressing it violently. Three years ago Jessica Mathews, now head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggested that centuries of governmental dominance might finally be ending.</br></br>If that was plausible three years ago, it now seems even more compelling. In 1997 a loose alliance of 350 NGOs from 23 countries set out to ban land mines; they soon persuaded 122 nations to sign on to a treaty. In 1998 another NGO alliance, this time reckoned to number 600 groups in nearly 70 countries, sank a painstakingly negotiated treaty on multilateral investment. This year yet another coalition, known as Jubilee 2000, led an international lobbying effort for Third World debt relief. During the recent budget fight, Jubilee pressure had much to do with the congressional Republicans' last-minute assent to provide money for debt cancellation.</br></br>Fresh from those victories, the NGO community has descended on Seattle to take on the international trading system. Many of the lead players from previous NGO victories are there; they greet each other in hallways with the camaraderie of veterans. Their rhetoric paints the World Trade Organization as a proto-government possessed of frightening power, but their own clout is just as striking. The WTO has a budget of just $80 million a year and a staff of fewer than 500. NGO coalitions wield more money and have thousands of expert delegates in Seattle.\n",

Even those contractors who didn't have employees taken in the raid felt the impact, if only temporarily. \"It slowed down the building process for a couple of days,\" says Don Carrington, a vice president at D.R. Kidd Co., a roofing contractor in Austin.</br></br>The raids and others across the Austin area at the time yielded more than 1,100 arrests -- part of a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigrants in the workplace. Indeed, the raids in Central Texas, with its booming economy and an unemployment rate less than half the national average, spotlight the irony of the growing debate over federal immigration policy: While Congress passed late last month a bill that, among other things, makes it easier to deport illegal immigrants, economic necessity has already made immigrants, both legal and illegal, an integral part of the Texas economy.</br></br>These days, restaurants, landscapers, janitorial services and other businesses that account for large numbers of low-wage, low-skill jobs in Texas could scarcely operate without a ready supply of immigrant workers, documented and otherwise. Other industries -- notably, many construction trades -- have grown so dependent on immigrant labor that there is a serious dearth of skilled workers to take their place.</br></br>\"We're not honest in the sense that we need that labor,\" says Bill Gilmer, chief economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Houston. \"There's no question that we can stop illegal immigration, but we have not chosen that route.\" Adds Charles Foster, an immigration lawyer in Houston: \"If you could theoretically pick up all the illegal workers in the state of Texas, it would be devastating. It would have an immediate, drastic impact on a lot of businesses.\"\n",

The problems that dominate day-to-day legislative business--e.g., reducing pollution and congestion, improving medical care, providing more police--are not resource problems: The sacrifices involved in paying for such things are not prohibitive.

For a quarter-century, says DeMuth, the government has been trying and largely failing to regulate the computer industry: \"Although it may lasso an individual firm such as Microsoft, it has no hope of corralling the entire industry as it did trucking and railroads in an earlier age.\"</br></br>However, more private wealth means more resources for the traditional lobbying of government, and more incentives for government to try something new. It is what DeMuth calls \"the New Executive State\" expanding through extortion.\n",

Last year, gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, grew at an inflation-adjusted 3.3%.</br></br>However, as the housing and auto slumps have deepened while business spending has started to wane, economists are taking another whack at their GDP forecasts. Earlier this month, the consensus estimate of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal called for GDP to grow about 2.3% in the first quarter, down from an estimate of 2.5% a month earlier. The forecast for the second quarter was unchanged at 2.4%. One-tenth of a percentage point in GDP amounts to about $13.5 billion.</br></br>\"The housing recession is likely to be a little deeper and much more prolonged than any of us have been thinking, and capital spending will be considerably weaker,\" said Nariman Behravesh, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight, which lowered its forecast of first-quarter GDP growth to 1.6% from 2.2%.</br></br>Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic consulting firm based in St. Louis, lowered its forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%. Economists at Morgan Stanley reduced their tracking of first-quarter GDP growth to 1.4% from 1.6% growth; the firm's estimate was as high as 2.2% in mid- March.\n",

Starts of single-family units fell slightly, while starts of multifamily units rose for the first time in three months. The department also revised its June report to show an overall increase of 4.4%. The rise previously was reported at 5.1%.</br></br>\"That's likely to be the highest increase for the rest of the year as higher interest rates are going to have a much more serious impact on the industry,\" said Bob Sheehan, economist at the National Apartment Association.</br></br>Single-family units starts in July decreased by 0.8% to an annual rate of 1,089,000 units. In June, this sector saw an increase of 8.5%. In May, the rate declined 8.1%. Single-family construction starts in July were 5.4% below the July 1987 pace.</br></br>Economists remain pessimistic about the outlook for single-family housing starts, as this sector is usually more sensitive to interest rates than multifamily housing.\n",

The $1.4 billion spending plan approved unanimously by the board did not raise taxes or carve deeply into government services.</br></br>\"We're right where we were again last year,\" said Board Chairman Thomas M.

Officials said some of the increase was because of the slow pace of the recovery, while $22 million was attributed to several factors that were not included in the last projection, such as inflation and increasing health insurance and retirement costs.</br></br>Even with the worsening picture, Davis said he is optimistic that the county will be able to balance its fiscal 1995 budget without severe pain.\n",

Concerns over India's gaping current-account deficit worsened the local unit's fall.</br></br>Mr. Subbarao's comments debunk observations by some economists that the rupee's weakness has a silver lining as it makes Indian exports more competitive, while also discouraging nonessential imports because of higher cost.\n",

For now, economists say the balance sheets of most companies are strong enough to handle the added borrowing.</br></br>In fact, the moves could help the stock market deal with an expected slowdown in profit gains later this year as the economy contracts. That is because both higher dividends, and buybacks that raise earnings per share by reducing the number of outstanding shares, could help offset any decline in profit growth.</br></br>Nonfinancial companies saw their debt rise 6.3% in the 12 months that ended in the first quarter to $5.5 trillion. That is the fastest yearly growth for debt in five years. In 2005, debt increased at an average 12-month pace of 5.1%, while in 2004 debt growth was 2.7%, according to John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service. Debt is expected to have increased about 7% in the second quarter.</br></br>The rosy debt scenario is predicated on an economy that doesn't weaken significantly, and on interest rates not climbing much higher, both of which would make the increased debts more of a burden.

Without such a policy shift, the U.S. economy faces the risk of a significant economic downturn.</br></br>Three separate but related forces are now threatening economic activity: a credit market crisis, a decline in house prices and home building, and a reduction in consumer spending. These developments compound the general weakening of the economy earlier in the year, marked by slowing employment growth and declining real spendable incomes.</br></br>The current credit market crisis was started by widespread defaults on subprime mortgages. Borrowers with poor credit histories and uncertain incomes had bought homes with adjustable-rate mortgages characterized by high loan-to-value ratios and very low initial \"teaser\" interest rates. The mortgage brokers who originated those risky loans sold them quickly to sophisticated buyers who bundled them into large pools and then sold participation in those pools to other investors, typically in the form of tranches with different estimated degrees of risk. Many of the buyers then used these to enhance yields in structured bonds or even money market funds.</br></br>Many subprime borrowers eventually had difficulty making their monthly payments, especially when teaser rates rose to market levels. The resulting defaults exceeded what investors in the mortgage pools had expected.</br></br>Credit risk in financial markets had been underpriced for years, with low credit spreads on risky bonds and inexpensive credit insurance derivatives provided by investors seeking to raise their portfolio returns. With such underpricing of risk, hedge funds and private equity firms substantially increased their leverage.\n",

            "TEXT --->  When Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld sought to draw a distinction recently between the \"Old Europe\" represented by France and Germany and the \"New Europe\" of the fledgling democracies in the east, he stirred up a hornet's nest of criticism among Europeans who believed he was trying to divide the continent into skeptics and supporters of American policy toward Iraq and the Middle East.</br></br>Rumsfeld's observation was the right answer, but to the wrong question. There is no simple dichotomy in Europe as to who supports military action against Baghdad. Just as in the United States, you can find liberals in every corner of Europe who want to see Saddam Hussein overthrown, by force if necessary, and conservatives who think a U.S.-led military campaign would be disastrous for Western interests.</br></br>Where Rumsfeld's comments struck closer to the mark was in the implied notion that Europe's center of gravity is shifting east. In the postmodern European order, where war is now largely unthinkable, power is no longer measured by military arsenals but by economic vigor. Next year, when the European Union embraces 10 new members, the 25-nation group will include 450 million relatively prosperous citizens and account for more than one-fifth of global economic activity. But as the EU expands toward Russia's doorstep and consolidates its economic power, the locus of Europe's future economic dynamism will lie with the former communist societies of Central and Eastern Europe.</br></br>Over the next decade, Europe's fastest growth rate and biggest income surge are projected to occur in the eastern swath, stretching from the Baltic states to Bulgaria. American and European companies are beginning to pour investments into the region, seeking to capitalize on the desires of youthful populations eager to raise their living standards to match those in the West and to take advantage of labor costs that are one-fifth those in Germany. Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive officer of General Electric, says the new eastern states entering the EU will be a key corporate target over the next five years and could prove, in the short term, to be a more lucrative market than China.</br></br>The attraction of \"New Europe\" is not hard to understand. Deprived of material comforts during four decades of communism, tens of millions of Central and Eastern Europeans are determined to make up for lost time by acquiring the emblems of prosperity -- fast cars, stylish furniture, chic clothes and second homes -- that their cousins in the West have long taken for granted. The consumer frenzy gathering momentum in the east has not been witnessed on the continent since the go-go '50s, when Germany's postwar economic miracle bolstered the rest of Western Europe.\n",

The reduction also meant that U.S.I. fell below market-capitalization requirements of the NYSE; hence, it switched to Nasdaq.</br></br>U.S.I. focuses on small to midsize businesses, traditionally companies employing between 20 and 1,000 people. It has been built mainly through the acquisition of smaller, independent firms, and the offering was designed to help the company trim some of the debt accumulated through those transactions.</br></br>The company is using proceeds from the offering, which was led by Merrill Lynch & Co. and J.P.

Here, after recently acknowledging that American prosperity could be threatened by the escalating global financial crisis, Greenspan is weighing whether short-term interest rates should be reduced when Fed policymakers meet in 10 days.</br></br>\"We're asking the chairman to be proactive,\" said Laney, who heads the National Association of Manufacturers' small and medium-size business subcommittee. The NAM is among a group of business interests from Wall Street to Main Street clamoring for an immediate cut in interest rates to bolster the U.S. economy and help combat a global economic slowdown.</br></br>Businesses are calling for lower rates for a variety of reasons -- some of which openly are in self-interest. Some argue that cutting the cost of consumer and business borrowing would stimulate a cooling U.S. economy, and counterbalance falling foreign demand for U.S. goods. Others believe easier credit would provide a crucial psychological boost to skittish financial markets on Wall Street and overseas.</br></br>\"It's the domino effect,\" said Laney, whose company makes window casings for heavy trucks and buses. Laney reasons that if shipments to Asia are slumping, there will be less demand for trucks to carry U.S.-made goods to and from the ports -- and eventually less need for Laney's products.\n",

It would also make outright cuts in some poverty programs, such as a reduction by a fourth in the amount the government devoted last year to \"community services\" grants for dispossessed neighborhoods.</br></br>At the same time, the president is seeking nearly $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that would largely benefit the wealthy while potentially squeezing social spending for years to come. White House officials contend that such cuts would ultimately help the poor more than direct government aid because they are supposed to spur faster economic growth, which would raise wages and pull more people into the workforce. In effect, they say, pro-investment tax policy is Bush's boldest anti-poverty program.</br></br>\"Small changes in long-term growth have very large effects on our standards of living,\" said R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. \"Once you realize that, everything else is secondary.\"</br></br>Affecting many federal agencies, the changes Bush wants to make in anti-poverty efforts reveal a bold aspect of his vision of government that he seldom discusses publicly.

The regulators are likelyto cite commercial-property debt problems as a major reason why at least some of the large banks need additional capital.</br></br>Such losses likely would cause even deeper misery, and risk of failure, at small and medium banks because they tend to have disproportionally more exposure to commercial real-estate loans than giant institutions. While regulators have indicated they won't allow the 19 stress-tested banks to fail, that group doesn't include more than 500 banks with assets of less than $1 billion that have too much exposure to commercial real estate and are at the most risk of failing, according to an analysis by Foresight Analytics LLC.</br></br>During the housing boom, small and regional banks doubled down on lending to home builders and commercial-property developers and investors as they were largely squeezed out of the home mortgage market by large banks and Wall Street firms.

Both afford a glimpse into domestic life in the early 18th century that surprises us 20th-century voyeurs. Drive onto the roads that, lead to these houses from Rte. 3E and you drive clean out of our era ÛÓ not because of the oxen and the costumed employes, but because this land was part of the beginning of America.</br></br>The Lees, of course, are as close as we come in this country to aristocracy, and the ancestral home .ia as impressive in its setting as any English castle. Stratford has had no majt.Ûª- changes since 1730. It was occupied until L822 by members of the Lee family, that remarkable line that produced two signers of the Declaration of Independence and a general of the Annies of the Confederacy. The lineage is all set forth in the re- ception center through which you pass before entering the house, and itÛªs worth a quick look; the generations do confuse. You may, however, get sidetracked looking at the family christening dress and some of the Lee jewelry, like the mourning locket, in the adjacent cases.</br></br>There are only a few actual Lee pieces among the furniture in Stratford, but everything is authentic to the period, 1630-1810. The costumed hostesses, steeped in the Lee genealogy and each wearing a necklace featuring the squirrel so prominent in the Lee coat of arms, are full of wonderful stories about life in the old house.</br></br>Surely the most touching is the one about Robert E. Lee, not yet 4, who had to leave home with his mother and younger brothers when his half-brother inherited the house. With the coach waiting in the courtyard to take them to a new home, Robert turned up missing.

He said that, when inflation is factored in, the yuan was strengthening quickly against the dollar.</br></br>\"Because their inflation rates are so much higher than ours, it's actually appreciating in real terms against the United States at a rate -- if continued -- roughly 10% a year or more,\" Mr. Geithner said. \"If that were sustained, that would bring about a major shift in the competitive balance in our favor over time, which is necessary and important not just to us but for all of China's trading partners.\"\n",

Now, however, the pressure on profit is prompting firms including United Technologies Corp. and Dow Chemical to cut more costs.</br></br>Coffee chain Starbucks last week warned that customer traffic in U.S. cafes began slowing in June. The softness continued in July, so the company cut its earnings guidance for the third quarter. \"This is not a Starbucks issue,\" said Howard Schultz, chief executive. \"This is a macro problem of weak consumer confidence.\"\n",

But as the U.S. economy struggles and flirts with the prospect of deflation, some central bank officials are publicly broaching a controversial idea: lifting inflation above the Fed's informal target.</br></br>The rationale is that getting inflation up even temporarily would push \"real\" interest rates--nominal rates minus inflation--down, encouraging consumers and businesses to save less and to spend or invest more.</br></br>Both inside and outside the Fed, though, such an approach is controversial. It could undermine the anti-inflation credibility the Fed won three decades ago by raising interest rates to double-digits to beat back late-1970s price surges. \"It's a big mistake,\" said Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, a central bank historian. \"Higher inflation is not going to solve our problem. Any gain from that experience would be temporary,\" adding that the economy would suffer later.</br></br>Others warn that pushing inflation higher than the target could create public confusion and risk fueling financial bubbles and market instability.

            "TEXT --->  In your Nov. 16 Technology Journal article \"Outsourcing Firms Shift Gears in Tight Market,\" the outsourcing development may be quite positive for the industry. As you point out, the U.S. outsourcing market is changing and 1999 revenues that were inflated by Y2K and ERP spending are unlikely to reappear anytime soon. Nevertheless, there are many positive trends, including global expansion of outsourcing to offset slower growth in a more mature U.S. market, greater spending on infrastructure, applications management and network services to facilitate the transition to e-business, and an aging federal information technology staff that will accelerate federal sector outsourcing, especially to enable e-government.</br></br>If the so-called outsourcing dinosaurs have been outflanked by their smaller, newer competitors, the tide may well be reversing in favor of size, broad experience and financial staying power as the scramble for qualified IT staff intensifies. At a time when corporate IT departments and governmental agencies alike are confronting a work force nearing retirement, new IT graduates favor established outsourcers and shun the civil service. This will only intensify the trend toward outsourcing.</br></br>If so, stock investors would be well advised to adopt a longer-term investment horizon. Announcements of layoffs should be understood as normal repositionings by outsourcers that acquire new staff with each contract win. They don't necessarily presage revenue shortfalls, and the growth of revenues from non-U.S. market doesn't signal a souring of the U.S. market.</br></br>Albert Nekimken</br></br>Vice President\n",

            "TEXT --->  MARYLAND OFFICIALS were saying proudly a couple of months ago that they expected the state to run a modest surplus in the current fiscal year. Now they're looking at a deficit instead. To begin to ward it off, Gov. Parris Glendening this week ordered more than $200 million in budget cuts, and it's likely there will be more if, as expected, the Sept. 11 attacks accentuate the economic slowdown that was already underway.</br></br>The same pattern is evident in Virginia, though there, officials struggling to protect the governor's irresponsible car tax repeal have been slower to respond. The state was giddily projecting 7.5 percent revenue growth for the fiscal year. In fact, in the first quarter of the year, from July through September, revenue collections were down 2.4 percent from the year before, and that too was mainly before the September attacks.</br></br>The District is in a similar bind. The attack on the Pentagon, the temporary closing of Reagan National Airport and the drop-off in tourism have delivered sharp blows to the city's economy. As D.C. chief financial officer Natwar Gandhi announced yesterday, it seems possible that local sources of revenue could be reduced by as much as $90 million to $100 million in fiscal 2002 compared with the fiscal 2002 budget estimate. And there's a good chance the current revenue estimate for fiscal 2003 will also need to be reduced.</br></br>The District's difficulties are compounded by its debt burden, the second highest in the nation among cities. That heavy load limits the city's borrowing capability. And the city's problem is more basic: a long-term structural imbalance between its revenue base and required expenditures, brought on by restrictions on the city's taxing authority. Five years of economic good times masked that imbalance, as Mr. Gandhi said yesterday. With the economy souring, \"the imbalance will become glaringly apparent,\" he said.</br></br>All over the country, state and local governments are having to cut back, or else raise taxes. They have no choice; their revenues are down and they are bound by law or tradition to balance their budgets. But the squeeze occurs at precisely the wrong time. By cutting back, the states amplify the downturn that afflicts them, and the amplification is the greater because the cuts come just as more people are qualifying for unemployment benefits, welfare and Medicaid; spending goes down when it ought to be going up. This time around, state and local officials, particularly in such areas as this, face sharply increased security costs as well.\n",

            "TEXT --->  Budget cutters, as predicted here May 17, have settled on a cost-sharing change for health insurance premiums that could hit federal employees harder than raising the retirement age or a less generous pension-setting formula.</br></br>Some feds still are battling the idea of a higher retirement age, even though it's been a dead issue for some time. Others fear the pay-more-get-less pension plan part of the House tax cut bill. It would force workers to pay an additional 2.5 percent of salary to the retirement fund. It would change the formula used to compute annuities (now the employee's highest three-year average salary) to a high-four system in 1996 and a high-five formula for anyone retiring in 1997 or thereafter.</br></br>That proposal -- which would impose a payroll surtax on federal workers to finance tax cuts for upper-income nonfederal workers -- may fizzle or be altered. It passed the House but found few friends in the Senate. The high-three to high-five plan also is up in the air.</br></br>But while workers and their unions were understandably preoccupied watching proposed retirement changes, budget-cutters have agreed on a change that would have a bigger effect on feds and retirees. Under a worst-case scenario, it could have workers and retirees paying 50 percent to 75 percent of their health premiums within a few years. Currently, employees and retirees pay less than 25 percent of their premiums. That percentage remains the same even when overall premiums rise. But under a budget compromise tentatively approved by Republican congressional leaders, employees would shift to a voucher system. Workers and retirees would get a fixed amount -- adjusted each year for inflation -- to buy a health plan. Next year, for example, someone buying a single plan would get $1,535 from Uncle Sam, and an employee or retiree buying a family plan would get $3,400. Based on 1995 premiums, that is a generous split.</br></br>But because the voucher would be adjusted annually based on the regular inflation rate -- rather than the much higher annual medical inflation rate -- the employee or retiree share of premiums would increase over time, while the government share would shrink.\n",

The state is spending $50,000 to advertise in national newspapers to attract people back to the place from which thousands fled in the early 1980s when unemployment skyrocketed past 15%. One private company alone says it has about 1,000 openings.</br></br>On behalf of hundreds of companies looking for skilled workers ranging from engineers and computer analysts to construction workers, the five-week campaign is essentially a huge help-wanted ad for the state. The ad, touted by Gov. John Engler's administration as proof of Michigan's economic comeback, comes complete with a list of fringe benefits, including affordable housing, 11,000 inland lakes and the nation's highest number of golf courses. Likely to be added soon: \"Home of the Stanley Cup Champions,\" after Detroit's beloved Red Wings won the title Saturday night.

Yet much of what the Fed and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, have done is shrouded in confusion and misperceptions.1The Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman issued a famous dictum nearly 50 years ago: \"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\" His belief has become widespread over the years, to the point that even many non-economists assume that when the Fed prints money, higher prices inevitably result. But the link between money and inflation is weaker than people think.</br></br>The Fed's current policy of \"quantitative easing\"essentially means it is printing money ($600 billion) to buy assets such as government bonds. The Fed isn't literally printing the $20 bills that end up in your wallet - it's doing the electronic equivalent. When it buys a $100 bond from a bank, it deposits $100 into the bank's account at the Fed. This electronic money is called reserves, and the Fed conjures it up out of thin air.</br></br>However, this money can lead to inflation only if banks lend it and consumers and businesses spend it. Banks lend when they have strong balance sheets and when credit-worthy customers demand loans. People and businesses spend when their incomes are growing and they're confident about the future. None of this has been true lately.</br></br>The Fed is trying to stimulate spending, but not by showering people with newly minted dollars. Rather, when the Fed buys bonds, it pushes their prices up and their yields down. Lower long-term interest rates will tempt some people to borrow. They will also make stocks more attractive. Higher stock prices will make consumers feel wealthier and spend more. If that spending outstrips the economy's productive capacity, inflation could result. But that's years away: The economy today is awash in idle factories and unemployed workers.</br></br>2Since Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted in late August that the Fed might resume quantitative easing, the value of the dollar has fallen steadily, dropping 7 percent against the euro, 3 percent against the yen and 7 percent against the Korean won. Many foreign officials and analysts have accused the Fed of deliberately driving down the dollar to give U.S. exporters a competitive advantage abroad.\n",

            "TEXT --->  WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. postponed for six months an increase in the premium banks and thrifts pay for deposit insurance and said that it will design a system that requires weak banks to pay higher premiums than strong banks.</br></br>The delay until Jan. 1, 1993, is a huge victory for banks. They have argued that a premium increase isn't necessary to rebuild the bankrupt Bank Insurance Fund and that higher fees now would hurt bank profits, cramp lending and slow the economic recovery. Several members of the Federal Reserve Board have also said that this is the wrong time for a large premium increase.</br></br>Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of the House Banking Committee, charged that \"deferral of the increases until next January provides a politically attractive means of reducing costs to banks and eliminating the politically unattractive spectacle of closing banks during an election year.\"</br></br>But FDIC Chairman William Taylor said in his announcement that the agency was postponing the premium increase and restructuring the insurance fees to rise with an institution's probability of failure because \"the current flat rate system places an unfair burden on well-managed banks.\" This is one of the points the banking industry has been making in a recent campaign against a premium increase.</br></br>Each one-cent increase in the premium costs the nation's 12,500 banks about $250 million annually. The FDIC last raised premiums July 1, 1991, by 3.5 cents.\n",

            "TEXT --->  Tropicana Products announced it would raise the wholesale price of its orange juices an average of 10 percent because of a sharply reduced Florida orange crop blamed on heavy winter rains and a dry summer and spring. That translates to about 30 cents to 40 cents more for consumers buying 64-ounce and 96-ounce containers. The higher prices will probably start showing up in stores in late November. Minute Maid, Tropicana's chief national competitor in the orange juice market, said it expected to announce a price increase \"in the near future.\"</br></br>A new U.S. savings bond plan will allow Americans to have the costs of the bonds automatically deducted from their bank accounts by the government. The new program, called the EasySaver Plan, is intended to complement the existing payroll deduction plan. Savers will be able to choose the dates they want the Treasury Department to charge their accounts -- a minimum of twice a year. The traditional Series EE bonds, which sell for half their face value, will be available in denominations ranging from $50 to $1,000. Series I bonds, which carry a lower interest rate but are adjusted to reflect inflation, also will be sold, at their full face value, in denominations from $50 to $1,000.</br></br>Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund taken over by 14 lenders last month, is seeking to refinance soon-to-expire credit lines from banks not involved in the rescue, a person familiar with the fund said. It also fired 18 percent of its staff to cut costs. Credit lines from banks not involved in the takeover financed about 10 percent of Long-Term Capital's $100 billion balance sheet, the source said.</br></br>Durable goods orders rose 0.9 percent in September, pulled higher by demand for automobiles, communications equipment and military goods. The unexpected fourth consecutive increase brought orders to a seasonally adjusted $192.1 billion, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected about a 1 percent drop, with world financial turmoil diminishing demand for U.S. products.</br></br>The Treasury sold $16.002 billion of two-year notes at a yield of 4.025 percent, the lowest in five years. Demand was considered subdued, judging by the bid/cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the number of bids to the amount of securities sold. The bid/cover ratio was 1.97, showing that there was less demand than at the Treasury's last monthly sale of two-year notes on Sept. 23 when the ratio was 2.39. The yield on the two-year notes sold yesterday was the lowest since 3.94 percent at the Oct. 26, 1993, auction. At the Sept. 23 auction, the notes yielded 4.615 percent.\n",

            "TEXT --->  NEW YORK -- CBS Inc., buffeted by a damaging slowdown in advertising and a big deficit on its billion-dollar baseball contract, posted a huge loss for the fourth quarter. Bracing for an even tougher year ahead, the company also slashed its quarterly dividend by 77%.</br></br>CBS's loss of $156 million, or $6.06 a share, caused by an aftertax charge of $170 million on its four-year baseball pact, was the largest quarterly loss in the company's history. In the year-earlier period, CBS had net income of $59.5 million, or $2.31 a share. Sales in the quarter rose 6.2% to $919.7 million from $865.8 million.</br></br>Even without the baseball write-down, CBS said its network had an operating loss in the quarter and will have an operating loss in 1991 that some analysts peg at $125 million. Moreover, the broadcast company's troubles are likely to be further aggravated in the first half by high costs of covering the Persian Gulf war and by ad pullouts on the part of sponsors that don't want to air commercials during war news. The pullouts come on top of already-sluggish ad sales in the current recession.</br></br>But CBS no longer will be able to offset the downturn with huge interest income, which has provided a large chunk of company earnings in the past two years. Interest income will plunge this year because the company's cash position was reduced by 70% when CBS spent $2 billion earlier this month to buy back almost half of all its common shares outstanding.</br></br>CBS Chairman Laurence A. Tisch said that the Persian Gulf war and the recession are \"suppressing\" CBS's sales and earnings. The company said profits fell and sales were flat at CBS's television stations and radio operations in the quarter. The outlook for all local TV and radio stations is bleak in the current advertising slump and recession.\n",

Ties that look like amoebas marching across the Hawaiian flag, like a pool table dressed up as a rain forest, like a squadron of Chiclets lost in space, like the colorblindness test that kept your Uncle Lou out of the Army.</br></br>You see them all over downtown Washington, laid out in the paneled eternity of Britches at $50-or-so apiece. Or hung out by street vendors in three-for-$10 clusters so thick you could use them as automatic carwash brushes.

And power ties were the fixed and final style for the Connecticut Avenue Commandos, the Gucci Gang, the K Street Torpedoes.</br></br>\"Power ties started in Washington,\" says Gerald Anderson, head of the Neckwear Association of America. They were little prints (called \"neats\"), often on a yellow background, the sort of thing you might reupholster a chair with if the Queen of England were coming to visit. Or polka dots, transcendently genteel in their tininess, as if someone had fired holes in the tie with a shotgun loaded with dust. There was something irreducible about them, the distillation of male respectability to a Zenlike potency.</br></br>It started with the trend-surfers, the retro freaks, the thrift- shop mavens. They were the first to spot the styles of the '40s and '50s as a growth stock. Soon you saw these ties on hip waiters and art gallery assistants, on men who spent a lot of time in New York or Los Angeles, which were places that had never treated the power tie as some kind of bias-cut Shroud of Turin.\n",

            "TEXT --->  When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.</br></br>There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.</br></br>As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.</br></br>The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.</br></br>Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992.\n",

            "TEXT --->  Is your retirement secure? [para] For some people who thought they had taken care of everything, the answer may be riding on another question: Is your retirement community secure? [para] Anne Bradt, 83, said she and fellow residents thought they had bought themselves worry-free retirements when they put down hundreds of thousands of dollars -- upwards of $900,000 each -- to move into Sherburne Commons in Nantucket, Mass. Then, a year ago, the nonprofit company that runs the place sought bankruptcy protection. Food service was cut to one meal a day. Activities such as dance and music disappeared, along with the activities director and other members of the staff. Residents could still pull a cord if they needed emergency help in the shower, but they would have to pay extra for the lifeline, and the person answering the call would no longer be on the premises.[para] Bradt's life became caught up in a complex legal proceeding, with her entire deposit at risk. [para] \"It's been one year of absolute hell,\" Bradt said. \"It's taken its toll physically and mentally.\" The recession and the real estate crisis have raised new concerns for people who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, as much money as it might take to buy a home, just to enter retirement communities. The deposits typically earn seniors the privilege of moving in; they do not confer any ownership in the real estate, and they are in addition to monthly fees that can total thousands of dollars.</br></br>In theory, residents can reclaim the money when they move out, or their heirs can recoup it when they die. But the model can break down when the communities' economic assumptions prove too optimistic.</br></br>The October bankruptcy filing of another firm -- Erickson Retirement Communities, a major developer and manager of campuses for senior citizens -- casts a spotlight on the risks.</br></br>Erickson has been a leader in the world of \"continuing care retirement communities\" -- CCRCs -- which offer independent living, assisted living and nursing home care. In the Washington area, Erickson communities include Riderwood in Silver Spring and Greenspring in Springfield. People move in while they are still able to live independently, hoping it will be their last major move. One of the main advantages is that seniors can stay in the same community as their health deteriorates, and couples can avoid being separated in their declining years.</br></br>For some Erickson residents, including early occupants of the Ashby Ponds development in Ashburn, it may not work out that way. The weak economy prompted Erickson to halt development of several projects before completing the assisted-living or nursing facilities.\n",

As they see it, the January barometer is nothing more than an old wives' tale.</br></br>\"The market itself has been in a strong upward trend for the past 70 years,\" observes Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest newsletter. As a result, the odds are that any given January will show gains, and so will any given year.

But because international competition will remain intense amid weak demand, she said, virtually all U.S. industries will remain under price pressure.</br></br>The positive effect of that pressure is that a rise in short-term interest rates isn't likely over the next 12 months, and longterm rates could decline further, she added. Moreover, her reading of economic figures and anecdotal evidence from corporate members of the Conference Board indicate that \"the talk about an increase in inflation is absolutely crazy.\"</br></br>The spate of recent job cut announcements also suggests that business executives are not expecting robust growth. In June, big companies announced 38,669 layoffs, compared with 14,086 in May, according to the Challenger Employment Report, which tracks corporate announcements.

And the senators said lower capital-gains taxes shouldn't be retroactive to Jan. 1, as the House and Wall Street want, but should take effect for assets sold as of last Friday.</br></br>The Senate package, based on House Republicans' \"Contract With America\" tax cuts, also would expand Individual Retirement Accounts, as financial interests sought; slash or even wipe out the estate taxes for many family-owned small businesses and farms; and provide relief to corporations that pay the alternative minimum tax. Together with the family credit and capital gains relief, those provisions and others are aimed at cutting taxes $245 billion over seven years to offset the political pain of the Republicans' spending cuts to balance the budget.</br></br>The Senate Finance Committee measure also would extend some business tax breaks that have expired, chiefly a 20% credit for research costs, and create some others. It would offset the cost of those benefits by curbing tax advantages for pharmaceutical manufacturers and other companies with operations in Puerto Rico, for corporate-owned life insurance, movie studios, family-farm corporations such as Tyson Foods Inc. and others.</br></br>Chairman William Roth (R., Del.), said the committee will meet in open session Wednesday to consider the package, which then will be added to a separate budget-balancing measure for a full Senate vote. Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas called it \"a tax package that keeps our word to the American people,\" and said Senate debate on the combined budget and tax measure could begin next week.

On Wednesday the Commerce Department released its flash estimate putting second-quarter real growth at a snappy 5.7% annual rate, and also revised the first-quarter estimate upward nearly a full point, to a soaring 9.7%. Bonds sank. Equities plunged, then rebounded to end the day with a gain.</br></br>Are the markets afraid of growth? Isn't growth what we want? Why this confusion and turmoil? Yes, we agree, no one wants inflation, but inflation is not caused by growth. Inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods, remember? And growth means more goods, remember? And just for the record, with the new growth figures naturally come new GNP deflators, showing inflation falling to a rate of 2.8% in the second quarter from 3.9% in the first.</br></br>To end the coyness, we understand perfectly well why the markets are in turmoil. The markets are not afraid of growth. The markets are afraid of the Federal Reserve Board.</br></br>We yield to no one in our admiration of Paul Volcker. If we had to pick one mortal on the face of the earth to run monetary policy out of his hip pocket, he would be our instant choice. But Chairman Volcker has to keep lecturing the markets about \"overreacting\" -- to the latest money supply figures, to his own statements, or to whatever else the market may settle on as a clue to whether he may ease or tighten. Just now, the markets have decided that the clue to Fed policy is real growth, and this overreaction sends them schizoid. They know growth is good, but worry that the Fed thinks that fine-tuning real growth is the key to controlling inflation. They worry that if growth comes in better than the economists' computers think it ought to, the Fed will feel impelled to stamp it out by tightening money.</br></br>Where would the markets get the notion the Fed might follow such a screwy theory? Well, just possibly the money managers have read the most recently released minutes of the Fed's Open Market Committee. At its March 26-27 meeting the FOMC voted to tighten, raising the target range of the federal funds rate to 7 1/2%-11 1/2% from the 6%-10% that had prevailed since November.
